    <h3>WHY STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS PROUD OF HIS STRIPES</h3>

    <p>The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind are great
    friends of Striped Chipmunk. They hurry to call on him the very
    first thing every morning after Old Mother West Wind has
    brought them down from the Purple Hills. They always beg him to
    stop and play with them, but often he refuses. But he does it
    in such a merry way and with such a twinkle in his eyes that
    the Merry Little Breezes never get cross because he won't play.
    No, Sir, they never get cross. If anything, they think just a
    little bit more of Striped Chipmunk because he won't play. You
    see, they know that the reason he won't play is because he has
    work to do, and Striped Chipmunk believes and says:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"When there is work for me to do<br /></span>
            <span>The sooner started, sooner through."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>So every morning they ask him to play, and every morning
    they laugh when he says he has too much to do. Then they rumple
    up his hair and pull his whiskers and give him last tag and
    race down to the Smiling Pool to see Grandfather Frog and beg
    him for a story. Now Grandfather Frog is very old and very
    wise, and he knows all about the days when the world was young.
    When he is feeling just right, he dearly loves to tell about
    those long-ago days.</p>

    <p>One morning the Merry Little Breezes found Grandfather Frog
    sitting as usual on his big green lily-pad, and they knew by
    the way he folded his hands across his white and yellow
    waistcoat that it was full of foolish green flies.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Grandfather Frog, please do tell us why it is that
    Striped Chipmunk has such beautiful stripes on his coat,"
    begged one of the Merry Little Breezes.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! They are stripes of honor," replied Grandfather
    Frog, in his deep, gruff voice.</p>

    <p>"Honor! Oh, how lovely! Do tell us about it! Please do!"
    begged the Merry Little Breezes.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" began Grandfather Frog, his big, goggly eyes
    twinkling. "Once upon a time, when the world was young, old Mr.
    Chipmunk, the grandfather a thousand times removed of Striped
    Chipmunk, lived very much as Striped Chipmunk does now. He was
    always very busy, very busy, indeed, and it was always about
    his own affairs. 'By attending strictly to my own business, I
    have no time to meddle with the affairs of my neighbors, and so
    I keep out of trouble,' said old Mr. Chipmunk,"</p>

    <p>"Just what Striped Chipmunk says now," broke in one of the
    Merry Little Breezes.</p>

    <p>"That shows that he is just as wise as was his grandfather a
    thousand times removed, about whom I am telling you," replied
    Grandfather Frog. "Old Mr. Chipmunk wore just a little, plain
    brown coat. It didn't worry him a bit, not a bit, that his coat
    was just plain brown. It kept him just as warm as if it were a
    beautiful red, like that of Mr. Fox, or handsome black and
    white, like that of Mr. Skunk. He was perfectly satisfied with
    his little plain brown coat and took the best of care of
    it.</p>

    <p>"One day as he was hurrying home to dinner, he climbed up on
    an old stump to look around and make sure that the way was
    clear. Over in a little path in the meadow grass was walking
    old Mr. Meadow Mouse. He was strolling along as if there was
    nothing in the world to fear. Way back behind him in the same
    little path, walking very fast but very quietly, was big Mr.
    Bob Cat. His eyes were yellow, and a hungry look was in them.
    He didn't see Mr. Meadow Mouse, but he would in a few minutes.
    Mr. Chipmunk saw that he would, and that there was no place for
    Mr. Meadow Mouse to hide.</p>

    <p>"'Humph! I never meddle in other people's affairs, and this
    is none of my business,' said little Mr. Chipmunk.</p>

    <p>"But old Mr. Meadow Mouse was a friend. He thought a great
    deal of Mr. Meadow Mouse, did little Mr. Chipmunk. He couldn't
    bear to think of what would happen to Mr. Meadow Mouse if big
    Mr. Bob Cat should catch him. Then, almost without realizing
    what he was doing, little Mr. Chipmunk began to shout at big
    Mr. Bob Cat and to call him names. Of course big Mr. Bob Cat
    looked up right away and saw little Mr. Chipmunk sitting on the
    old stump. His eyes grew yellower and yellower, he drew his
    lips back from his long, sharp teeth in a very angry way, and
    his little bob tail twitched and twitched. Then, with great
    leaps, he came straight for the old stump on which little Mr.
    Chipmunk was sitting.</p>

    <p>"Little Mr. Chipmunk didn't wait for him to get there. Oh,
    my, no! He took one good look at those fierce, hungry, yellow
    eyes and long, cruel teeth, and then he whisked into a hole in
    the old stump. You see, there wasn't time to go anywhere else.
    Big Mr. Bob Cat found the hole in the stump right away. He
    snarled when he saw it. You see it was too small, very much too
    small, for him to get into himself. But he could get one hand
    and arm in, and he did, feeling all around inside for little
    Mr. Chipmunk. Little Mr. Chipmunk was frightened almost to
    death. Yes, Sir, he was frightened almost to death. He made
    himself just as flat as he could on the bottom of the hollow
    and held his breath.</p>

    <p>"'You'd better come out of there, Mr. Chipmunk, or I'll pull
    you out!' snarled Mr. Bob Cat.</p>

    <p>"Little Mr. Chipmunk just snuggled down flatter than ever
    and didn't say a word. Mr. Bob Cat felt round and round inside
    the hollow stump and raked his long claws on the sides until
    little Mr. Chipmunk's hair fairly stood up. Yes, Sir, it stood
    right up on end, he was so scared. When it did that, it tickled
    the claws of Mr. Bob Cat. Mr. Bob Cat grinned. It was an ugly
    grin to see. Then he reached in a little farther and made a
    grab for little Mr. Chipmunk. His wide-spread, sharp claws
    caught in little Mr. Chipmunk's coat near the neck and tore
    little strips the whole length of it.</p>

    <p>"Of course little Mr. Chipmunk squealed with pain, for those
    claws hurt dreadfully, but he was glad that his coat tore. If
    it hadn't, Mr. Bob Cat would surely have pulled him out. After
    a long time, Mr. Bob Cat gave up and went off, growling and
    snarling. When he thought it was safe, little Mr. Chipmunk
    crawled out of the old stump and hurried home. He ached and
    smarted terribly, and his little plain brown coat was torn in
    long strips.</p>

    <p>"'This is what I get for meddling in the affairs of other
    folks!' said little Mr. Chipmunk bitterly. 'If I'd just minded
    my own business, it wouldn't have happened.'</p>

    <p>"Just then he happened to look over to the house of Mr.
    Meadow Mouse. There was Mr. Meadow Mouse playing with his
    children. He didn't know a thing about what his neighbor,
    little Mr. Chipmunk, had done for him, for you remember he
    hadn't seen Mr. Bob Cat at all. Little Mr. Chipmunk grinned as
    well as he could for the pain.</p>

    <p>"'I'm glad I did it,' he muttered. 'Yes, Sir, I'm glad I did
    it, and I'm glad that Neighbor Meadow Mouse doesn't know about
    it. I'm glad that nobody knows about it.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>'A kindly deed's most kindly done<br /></span>
            <span>In secret wrought, and seen of none.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And so I'm glad that no one knows.'</p>

    <p>"Now just imagine how surprised little Mr. Chipmunk was,
    when in the fall it came time to put on a new coat, to have Old
    Mother Nature hand him out a beautiful striped coat instead of
    the little plain brown coat he had expected. Old Mother
    Nature's eyes twinkled as she said:</p>

    <p>"'There's a stripe for every tear made in your old coat by
    the claws of Mr. Bob Cat the day you saved Mr. Meadow Mouse.
    They are honor stripes, and hereafter you and your children and
    your children's children shall always wear stripes.'</p>

    <p>"And that is how it happens that Striped Chipmunk comes by
    his striped coat, and why he is so proud of it, and takes such
    good care of it," concluded Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <h3>WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS</h3>

    <p>Happy Jack Squirrel sat with his hands folded across his
    white waistcoat. He is very fond of sitting with his hands
    folded that way. A little way from him sat Peter Rabbit. Peter
    was sitting up very straight, but his hands dropped right down
    in front. Happy Jack noticed it.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you fold your hands the way I do, Peter Rabbit?"
    shouted Happy Jack.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't want to," stammered Peter.</p>

    <p>"You mean you can't!" jeered Happy Jack.</p>

    <p>Peter pretended not to hear, and a few minutes later he
    hopped away towards the dear Old Briar-patch,
    lipperty-lipperty-lip. Happy Jack watched him go, and there was
    a puzzled look in Happy Jack's eyes.</p>

    <p>"I really believe he can't fold his hands," said Happy Jack
    to himself, but speaking aloud.</p>

    <p>"He can't, and none of his family can," said a gruff
    voice.</p>

    <p>Happy Jack turned to find Old Mr. Toad sitting in the Lone
    Little Path.</p>

    <p>"Why not?" asked Happy Jack.</p>

    <p>"Ask Grandfather Frog; he knows," replied Old Mr. Toad, and
    started on about his business.</p>

    <p>And this is how it happens that Grandfather Frog told this
    story to the little meadow and forest people gathered around
    him on the bank of the Smiling Pool.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog. "Old Mr. Rabbit, the
    grandfather a thousand times removed of Peter Rabbit, was
    always getting into trouble. Yes, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was
    always getting into trouble. Seemed like he wouldn't be happy
    if he couldn't get into trouble. It was all because he was so
    dreadfully curious about other people's business, just as Peter
    Rabbit is now. It seemed that he was just born to be curious
    and so, of course, to get into trouble.</p>

    <p>"One day word came to the Green Forest and to the Green
    Meadows that Old Mother Nature was coming to see how all the
    little meadow and forest people were getting along, to settle
    all the little troubles and fusses between them, and to find
    out who were and who were not obeying the orders she had given
    them when she had visited them last. My, my, my, such a
    hurrying and scurrying and worrying as there was! You see,
    everybody wanted to look his best when Old Mother Nature
    arrived, Yes, Sir, everybody wanted to look his best.</p>

    <p>"There was the greatest changing of clothes you ever did
    see. Old King Bear put on his blackest coat. Mr. Coon and Mr.
    Mink and Mr. Otter sat up half the night brushing their suits
    and making them look as fine and handsome as they could. Even
    Old Mr. Toad put on a new suit under his old one, and planned
    to pull the old one off and throw it away as soon as Old Mother
    Nature should arrive. Then everybody began to fix up their
    homes and make them as neat and nice as they knew
    how&mdash;everybody but Mr. Rabbit.</p>

    <p>"Now Mr. Rabbit was lazy. He didn't like to work any more
    than Peter Rabbit does now. No, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was afraid
    of work. The very sight of work scared old Mr. Rabbit. You see,
    he was so busy minding other people's business that he didn't
    have time to attend to his own. So his brown and gray coat
    always was rumpled and tumbled and dirty. His house was a
    tumble-down affair in which no one but Mr. Rabbit would ever
    have thought of living, and his garden&mdash;oh, dear me, such
    a garden you never did see! It was all weeds and brambles. They
    filled up the yard, and old Mr. Rabbit actually couldn't have
    gotten into his own house if he hadn't cut a path through the
    brambles.</p>

    <p>"Now when old Mr. Rabbit heard that Old Mother Nature was
    coming, his heart sank way, way down, for he knew just how
    angry she would be when she saw his house, his garden and his
    shabby suit.</p>

    <p>"'Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?' wailed Mr. Rabbit,
    wringing his hands.</p>

    <p>"'Get busy and clean up,' advised Mr. Woodchuck, hurrying
    about his own work.</p>

    <p>"Now Mr. Woodchuck was a worker and very, very neat. He
    meant to have his home looking just as fine as he could make
    it. He brought up some clean yellow sand from deep down in the
    ground and sprinkled it smoothly over his doorstep.</p>

    <p>"'I'll help you, if I get through my own work in time,'
    shouted Mr. Woodchuck over his shoulder.</p>

    <p>"That gave Mr. Rabbit an idea. He would ask all his
    neighbors to help him, and perhaps then he could get his house
    and garden in order by the time Old Mother Nature arrived. So
    Mr. Rabbit called on Mr. Skunk and Mr. Coon and Mr. Mink and
    Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Chipmunk, and all the rest of his
    neighbors, telling them of his trouble and asking them to help.
    Now, in spite of the trouble Mr. Rabbit was forever making for
    other people by his dreadful curiosity and meddling with other
    people's affairs, all his neighbors had a warm place in their
    hearts for Mr. Rabbit, and they all promised that they would
    help him as soon as they had their own work finished.</p>

    <p>"Instead of hurrying home and getting to work himself, Mr.
    Rabbit stopped a while after each call and sat with his arms
    folded, watching the one he was calling on work. Mr. Rabbit was
    very fond of sitting with folded arms. It was very comfortable.
    But this was no time to be doing it, and Mr. Skunk told him
    so.</p>

    <p>"'If you want the rest of us to help you, you'd better get
    things started yourself,' said old Mr. Skunk, carefully combing
    out his big, plumy tail.</p>

    <p>"'That's right, Mr. Skunk! That's right!' said Mr. Rabbit,
    starting along briskly, just as if he was going to hurry right
    home and begin work that very instant.</p>

    <p>"But half an hour later, when Mr. Skunk happened to pass the
    home of Mr. Chipmunk, there sat Mr. Rabbit with his arms
    folded, watching Mr. Chipmunk hurrying about as only Mr.
    Chipmunk can.</p>

    <p>"Finally Mr. Rabbit had made the round of all his friends
    and neighbors, and he once more reached his tumble-down house.
    'Oh, dear,' sighed Mr. Rabbit, as he looked at the tangle of
    brambles which almost hid the little old house, 'I never, never
    can clear away all this! It will be a lot easier to work when
    all my friends are here to help,' So he sighed once more and
    folded his arms, instead of beginning work as he should have
    done. And then, because the sun was bright and warm, and he was
    very, very comfortable, old Mr. Rabbit began to nod, and
    presently he was fast asleep.</p>

    <p>"Now Old Mother Nature likes to take people by surprise, and
    it happened that she chose this very day to make her promised
    visit. She was greatly pleased with all she saw as she went
    along, until she came to the home of Mr. Rabbit.</p>

    <p>"'Mercy me!' exclaimed Old Mother Nature, throwing up her
    hands as she saw the tumble-down house almost hidden by the
    brambles and weeds. 'Can it be possible that any one really
    lives here?'</p>

    <p>Then, peering through the tangle of brambles, she spied old
    Mr. Rabbit sitting on his broken-down doorstep with his arms
    folded and fast asleep.</p>

    <p>"At first she was very indignant, oh, very indignant,
    indeed! She decided that Mr. Rabbit should be punished very
    severely. But as she watched him sitting there, dreaming in the
    warm sunshine, her anger began to melt away. The fact is, Old
    Mother Nature was like all the rest of Mr. Rabbit's
    neighbors&mdash;she just couldn't help loving happy-go-lucky
    Mr. Rabbit in spite of all his faults. With a long stick she
    reached in and tickled the end of his nose.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Rabbit sneezed, and this made him wake up. He yawned
    and blinked, and then his eyes suddenly flew wide open with
    fright. He had discovered Old Mother Nature frowning at him.
    She pointed a long forefinger at him and said:</p>

    <p>"'Hereafter, Mr. Rabbit, you and your children and your
    children's children will never again be able to sit with folded
    arms until you or they have learned to work.'</p>

    <p>"And that is why Peter Rabbit cannot fold his arms and still
    lives in a tumble-down house among the brambles," concluded
    Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <h3>WHY UNC' BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD</h3>

    <p>One thing puzzled Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped
    Chipmunk a great deal after they had come to know Unc' Billy
    Possum and his funny ways. They had talked it over and wondered
    and wondered about it, and tried to understand it, and even had
    asked Unc' Billy about it. Unc' Billy had just grinned and said
    that they would have to ask his mammy. Of course they couldn't
    do that, and Unc' Billy knew they couldn't, for Unc' Billy's
    mammy had died long before he even thought of coming up from
    Ol' Virginny to the Green Forest and the Green Meadows where
    they lived. He said it just to tease them, and when he said it,
    he chuckled until they chuckled too, just as if it really were
    the best kind of a joke.</p>

    <p>Now you know it always is the thing that you try and try to
    find out and can't find out that you most want to find out. It
    was just so with Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped
    Chipmunk. The more they talked about it, the more they wanted
    to know. Why was it that Unc' Billy Possum played dead instead
    of trying to run away when he was surprised by his enemies?
    They always tried to run away. So did everybody else of their
    acquaintance excepting Unc' Billy Possum.</p>

    <p>"There must be a reason" said Peter gravely, as he pulled
    thoughtfully at one of his long ears.</p>

    <p>"Of course there is a reason," asserted Johnny Chuck,
    chewing the end of a blade of grass.</p>

    <p>"There's a reason for everything," added Striped Chipmunk,
    combing out the hair of his funny little tail.</p>

    <p>"Then of course Grandfather Frog knows it," said Peter.</p>

    <p>"Of course! Why didn't we think of him before?" exclaimed
    the others.</p>

    <p>"I'll beat you to the Smiling Pool!" shouted Peter.</p>

    <p>Of course he did, for his legs are long and made for
    running, but Striped Chipmunk was not far behind. Johnny Chuck
    took his time, for he knew that he could not keep up with the
    others. Besides he was so fat that to run made him puff and
    blow. Grandfather Frog sat just as usual on his big green
    lily-pad, and he grinned when he saw who his visitors were, for
    he guessed right away what they had come for.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! What is it you want to know now?" he demanded,
    before Peter could fairly get his breath.</p>

    <p>"If you please, Grandfather Frog, we want to know why it is
    that Unc' Billy Possum plays dead," replied Peter as politely
    as he knew how.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog chuckled. "Just to fool people, stupid!"
    said he.</p>

    <p>"Of course we know that," replied Striped Chipmunk, "but
    what we want to know is how he ever found out that he could
    fool people that way, and how he knows that he will fool
    them."</p>

    <p>"I suspect that his mammy taught him," said Grandfather
    Frog, with another chuckle way down deep in his throat.</p>

    <p>"But who taught his mammy?" persisted Striped Chipmunk.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog snapped at a foolish green fly, and when it
    was safely tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat,
    he turned once more to his three little visitors, and there was
    a twinkle in his big, goggly eyes.</p>

    <p>"I see," said he, "that you <i>will</i> have a story, and I
    suppose that the sooner I tell it to you, the sooner you will
    leave me in peace. Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand
    times removed was&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Was this way back in the days when the world was young?"
    interrupted Peter.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog scowled at Peter. "If I have any more
    interruptions, there will be no story to-day" said he
    severely.</p>

    <p>Peter looked ashamed and promised that he would hold his
    tongue right between his teeth until Grandfather Frog was
    through. Grandfather Frog cleared his throat and began
    again.</p>

    <p>"Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand times removed
    was very much as Unc' Billy is now, only he was a little more
    spry and knew better than to stuff himself so full that he
    couldn't run. He was always very sly, and he played a great
    many tricks on his neighbors, and sometimes he got them into
    trouble. But when he did, he always managed to keep out of
    their way until they had forgotten all about their anger.</p>

    <p>"One morning the very imp of mischief seemed to get into old
    Mr. Possum's head. Yes, Sir, it certainly did seem that way.
    And when you see Mischief trotting along the Lone Little Path,
    if you look sharp enough, you'll see Trouble following at his
    heels like a shadow. I never knew it to fail. It's just as sure
    as a stomach-ache is to follow overeating."</p>

    <p>Just here Grandfather Frog paused and looked very hard at
    Peter Rabbit. But Peter pretended not to notice, and after
    slowly winking one of his big, goggly eyes at Johnny Chuck,
    Grandfather Frog continued:</p>

    <p>"Anyway, as I said before, the imp of mischief seemed to be
    in old Mr. Possum's head that morning, for he began to play
    tricks on his neighbors as soon as they were out of bed. He hid
    Old King Bear's breakfast, while the latter had his head
    turned, and then pretended that he had just come along. He was
    very polite and offered to help Old King Bear hunt for his lost
    breakfast. Then, whenever Old King Bear came near the place
    where it was hidden, old Mr. Possum would hide it somewhere
    else. Old King Bear was hungry, and he worked himself up into a
    terrible rage, for he was in a hurry for his breakfast. Old Mr.
    Possum was very sympathetic and seemed to be doing his very
    best to find the lost meal. At last Old King Bear turned his
    head suddenly and caught sight of old Mr. Possum hiding that
    breakfast in a new place. My, my, but his temper did boil over!
    It certainly did. And if he could have laid hands on old Mr.
    Possum that minute, it surely would have been the end of
    him.</p>

    <p>"But old Mr. Possum was mighty spry, and he went off through
    the Green Forest laughing fit to kill himself. Pretty soon he
    met Mr. Panther. He was very polite to Mr. Panther. He told him
    that he had just come from a call on Old King Bear, and hinted
    that Old King Bear was then enjoying a feast and that there
    might be enough for Mr. Panther, if he hurried up there at
    once.</p>

    <p>"Now, Mr. Panther was hungry, for he had found nothing for
    his breakfast that morning. So he thanked old Mr. Possum and
    hurried away to find Old King Bear and share in the good things
    old Mr. Possum had told about.</p>

    <p>"Old Mr. Possum himself hurried on, chuckling as he thought
    of the way Mr. Panther was likely to be received, with Old King
    Bear in such a temper. Pretty soon along came Mr. Lynx. Old Mr.
    Possum told him the same story he had told Mr. Panther, and Mr.
    Lynx went bounding off in a terrible hurry, for fear that he
    would not be in time to share in that good breakfast. It was
    such a good joke that old Mr. Possum tried it on Mr. Wolf and
    Mr. Fisher and Mr. Fox. In fact, he hunted up every one he
    could think of and sent them to call on Old King Bear, and
    without really telling them so, he made each one think that he
    would get a share in that breakfast."</p>

    <p>"Now, there wasn't any more breakfast than Old King Bear
    wanted himself, and by the time Mr. Panther arrived, there
    wasn't so much as a crumb left. Then, one after another, the
    others came dropping in, each licking his chops, and all very
    polite to Old King Bear. At first he didn't know what to make
    of it, but pretty soon Mr. Fox delicately hinted that they had
    come in response to the invitation sent by Mr. Possum, and that
    as they were all very hungry, they would like to know when the
    feast would be ready. Right away Old King Bear knew that old
    Mr. Possum had been up to some of his tricks, and he told his
    visitors that they were the victims of a practical joke.</p>

        <h4>"As they were all very hungry, they would like to know
        when the feast would be ready."</h4>
    </div>

    <p>"My, my, my, how angry everybody grew! With Old King Bear at
    their head, they started out to hunt for old Mr. Possum. When
    he saw them coming, he realized that what he had thought was a
    joke had become no longer a laughing matter for him. He was too
    frightened to run, so he scrambled up a tree. He quite forgot
    that Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx could climb just as fast as he.
    Up the tree after him they scrambled, and he crept as far out
    as he could get on one of the branches. Mr. Panther didn't dare
    go out there, so he just shook the branch. He shook and shook
    and shook and shook, and the first thing old Mr. Possum knew,
    he was flying through the air down to where the others were all
    ready to pounce on him.</p>

    <p>"Old Mr. Possum was frightened almost to death. He shut his
    eyes, and then he landed with a thump that knocked all the wind
    from his body. When he got his breath again, he still kept his
    eyes closed, for he couldn't bear the thought of looking at the
    cruel teeth and claws of Old King Bear and the others.
    Presently, while he was wondering why they didn't jump on him
    and tear him to pieces, Old King Bear spoke:</p>

    <p>"'I guess Mr. Possum won't play any more jokes, Mr.
    Panther,' said he. 'You just knocked the life out of him when
    you shook him off that branch.'</p>

    <p>"Mr. Panther came over and sniffed at Mr. Possum and turned
    him over with one paw. All the time Mr. Possum lay just as if
    he were dead, because he was too frightened to move. 'I didn't
    mean to kill him,' said Mr. Panther. 'We certainly will miss
    him. What will we do with him?'</p>

    <p>"'Leave him here as a warning to others,' growled Old King
    Bear.</p>

    <p>"Each in turn came up and sniffed of Mr. Possum, and then
    they all went about their business. He waited long enough to
    make sure that they were out of sight, and then took the
    shortest way home. When he got there and thought it all over,
    he thought that the best joke of all was the way he had made
    everybody think that he was dead. And then a bright idea struck
    him: he would try the same trick whenever he was caught. So the
    next time he got in trouble, instead of running away, he tried
    playing dead. It was such a success that he taught his children
    how to do it, and they taught their children, and so on down to
    Unc' Billy, whom you know. Unc' Billy says it is a lot easier
    than running away, and safer, too. Besides, it is always such a
    joke. Now, don't bother me any more, for I want to take a nap,"
    concluded Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>"Thank you!" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped
    Chipmunk, and started off to hunt up Unc' Billy Possum.</p>

    <h3>WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED</h3>

    <p>Peter Rabbit sat in the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch
    making faces and laughing at Reddy Fox. Of course that wasn't a
    nice thing to do, not a bit nice. But Peter had just had a
    narrow escape, a very narrow escape, for Reddy Fox had sprung
    out from behind a bush as Peter came down the Lone Little Path,
    and had so nearly caught Peter that he had actually pulled some
    fur out of Peter's coat. Now Peter was safe in the dear Old
    Briar-patch. He was a little out of breath, because he had had
    to use his long legs as fast as he knew how, but he was safe.
    You see, Reddy Fox wouldn't run the risk of tearing his
    handsome red coat on the brambles. Besides, they scratched
    terribly.</p>

    <p>"Never mind, Peter Rabbit, I'll get you yet!" snarled Reddy,
    as he gave up and started back for the Green Forest.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Reddy Fox is very sly!<br /></span> <span>Reddy
            Fox is very spry!<br /></span> <span>But sly and spry,
            'tis vain to try<br /></span> <span>To be as sly and
            spry as I."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>When Peter Rabbit shouted this, Reddy looked back and showed
    all his teeth, but Peter only laughed, and Reddy trotted on.
    Peter watched him out of sight.</p>

    <p>"My! I wish I had such a handsome coat," he said, with a
    long sigh, for you know Peter's coat is very plain, very plain,
    indeed.</p>

    <p>"You wouldn't, if you had to wear it for the same reason
    that Reddy Fox has to wear his. A good heart and honest ways
    are better than fine clothes, Peter Rabbit."</p>

    <p>Peter looked up. There was saucy, pert, little Jenny Wren
    fussing around in one of the old bramble bushes.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Jenny!" said Peter. "Why does Reddy wear a red
    coat?"</p>

    <p>"Do you mean to say that you don't know?" Jenny Wren looked
    very hard at Peter with her sharp eyes. "I thought everybody
    knew that! You certainly are slow, Peter Rabbit. I haven't time
    to tell you about it now. Go ask Grandfather Frog; he knows all
    about it." Jenny Wren bustled off before Peter could find his
    tongue.</p>

    <p>Now, you all know how full of curiosity Peter Rabbit is.
    Jenny Wren's busy tongue had set that curiosity fairly boiling
    over. He just couldn't sit still for wondering and wondering
    why Reddy Fox wears a red coat. He had never thought anything
    about it before, but now he couldn't get it out of his head. He
    just <i>had</i> to know. So, making sure that Reddy Fox had
    disappeared in the Green Forest, Peter started for the Smiling
    Pool, lipperty-lipperty-lip, as fast as he could go. There he
    found Grandfather Frog setting on his big green lily-pad, just
    as usual.</p>

    <p>"If you please, Grandfather Frog, why does Reddy Fox wear a
    red coat?" panted Peter, quite out of breath.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" grunted Grandfather Frog crossly. "Don't you
    know that it is very impolite to disturb people when they are
    having a nap?"</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I'm very sorry. Indeed I am, Grandfather Frog,"
    said Peter very humbly. "Will you tell me if I come again some
    time when you are not so sleepy?"</p>

    <p>Now, like everybody else, Grandfather Frog is rather fond of
    Peter Rabbit, and now Peter looked so truly sorry, and at the
    same time there was such a look of disappointment in Peter's
    eyes, that Grandfather Frog forgot all about his crossness.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said he. "You and your questions are a
    nuisance, Peter Rabbit, and I may as well get rid of you now as
    to have you keep coming down here and pestering me to death.
    Besides, any one who has to keep such a sharp watch for Reddy
    Fox as you do ought to know why he wears a red coat. If you'll
    promise to sit perfectly still and ask no foolish questions,
    I'll tell you the story."</p>

    <p>Of course Peter promised, and settled himself comfortably to
    listen. And this is the story that Grandfather Frog told:</p>

    <p>"A long time ago, when the world was young, old Mr. Fox, the
    grandfather a thousand times removed of Reddy Fox, was one of
    the smartest of all the forest and meadow people, just as Reddy
    is now. He was so smart that he knew enough not to appear
    smart, and the fact is his neighbors thought him rather dull.
    He wore just a common, everyday suit of dull brown, like most
    of the others, and there wasn't anything about him to attract
    attention. He was always very polite, very polite indeed, to
    every one. Yes, Sir, Mr. Fox was very polite. He always seemed
    to be minding his own business, and he never went around asking
    foolish questions or poking his nose into other people's
    affairs."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog stopped a minute and looked very hard at
    Peter after he said this, and Peter looked uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>"Now, although Mr. Fox didn't appear to take any interest in
    other people's affairs and never asked questions, he had two of
    the sharpest ears among all the little meadow and forest
    people, and while he was going about seeming to be just minding
    his own business, he was listening and listening to all that
    was said. Everything he heard he remembered, so that it wasn't
    long before he knew more about what was going on than all his
    neighbors together. But he kept his mouth tight closed, did Mr.
    Fox, and was very humble and polite to everybody. Every night
    he came home early and went to bed by sundown, and everybody
    said what good habits Mr. Fox had.</p>

    <p>"But when everybody else was asleep, Mr. Fox used to steal
    out and be gone half the night. Yes, Sir, sometimes he'd be
    gone until almost morning. But he always took care to get home
    before any of his neighbors were awake, and then he'd wait
    until everybody was up before he showed himself. When he came
    out and started to hunt for his breakfast, some one was sure to
    tell him of mischief done during the darkness of the night.
    Sometimes it was a storehouse broken into, and the best things
    taken. Sometimes it was of terrible frights that some of the
    littlest people had received by being wakened in the night and
    seeing a fierce face with long, sharp teeth grinning at them.
    Sometimes it was of worse things that were told in whispers.
    Mr. Fox used to listen as if very much shocked, and say that
    something ought to be done about it, and wonder who it could be
    who would do such dreadful things.</p>

    <p>"By and by things got so bad that they reached the ears of
    Old Mother Nature, and she came to find out what it all meant.
    Now, the very night before she arrived, Mrs. Quack, who lived
    on the river bank, had a terrible fright. Somebody sprang upon
    her as she was sleeping, and in the struggle she lost all her
    tail feathers. She hurried to tell Old Mother Nature all about
    it, and big tears rolled down her cheeks as she told how she
    had lost all her beautiful tail feathers. Mother Nature called
    all the people of the forest and the meadows together. She made
    them all pass before her, and she looked sharply at each one as
    they went by. Mr. Fox looked meeker than ever, and he was very
    humble and polite.</p>

    <p>"Now when Mr. Fox had paid his respects and turned his back,
    Old Mother Nature saw something red on the tail of his coat. It
    was nothing but a little smear of red clay, but that was enough
    for Old Mother Nature. You see, she knew that Mrs. Quack's home
    was right at the foot of a red claybank. She didn't say a word
    until everybody had paid their respects and passed before her.
    Then she told them how grieved she was to hear of all the
    trouble there had been, but that she couldn't watch over each
    one all the time; they must learn to watch out for
    themselves.</p>

    <p>"And so that you may know who to watch out for, from now on
    never trust the one who wears a bright red coat," concluded Old
    Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>"All of a sudden Mr. Fox became aware that everybody was
    looking at him, and in every face was hate. He glanced at his
    coat. It was bright red! Then Mr. Fox knew that he had been
    found out, and he sneaked away with his tail between his legs.
    The first chance he got, he went to Old Mother Nature and
    begged her to give him back his old coat. She promised that she
    would when his heart changed, and he changed his ways. But his
    heart never did change, and his children and his children's
    children were just like him. They have always been the smartest
    and the sliest and the most feared and disliked of all the
    little people on the meadows or in the forest. And now you know
    why Reddy Fox wears a red coat," concluded Grandfather
    Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit drew a long breath. "Thank you, thank you,
    Grandfather Frog!" said he. "I&mdash;I think hereafter I'll be
    quite content with my own suit, even if it isn't handsome.
    Jenny Wren was right. A good heart and honest ways are better
    than fine clothes."</p>

    <h3>WHY JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES</h3>

    <p>The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had just
    been released from the big bag in which she carries them every
    night to their home behind the Purple Hills and every morning
    brings them back to the Green Meadows to romp and play all day.
    They romped and raced and danced away, some one way, some
    another, to see whom they could find to play with. Presently
    some of them spied Jimmy Skunk slowly ambling down the Crooked
    Little Path, stopping every few steps to pull over a loose
    stone or stick. They knew what he was doing that for. They knew
    that he was looking for fat beetles for his breakfast. They
    danced over to him and formed a ring around him while they
    sang:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Who is it never, never hurries?<br /></span>
            <span>Who is it never, never worries?<br /></span>
            <span>Who is it does just what he pleases,<br /></span>
            <span>Just like us Merry Little Breezes?<br /></span>
            <span class="i2">Jimmy Skunk! Jimmy
            Skunk!"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now not so far away but that he could hear them very plainly
    sat Peter Rabbit, just finishing his breakfast in a
    sweet-clover patch. He sat up very straight, so as to hear
    better. Of course some of the Merry Little Breezes saw him
    right away. They left Jimmy to come over and dance in a circle
    around Peter, for Peter is a great favorite with them. And as
    they danced they sang:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Who is it hops and skips and jumps?<br /></span>
            <span>Who is it sometimes loudly thumps?<br /></span>
            <span>Who is it dearly loves to play,<br /></span>
            <span>But when there's danger runs away?<br /></span>
            <span class="i2">Peter Rabbit! Peter
            Rabbit!"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Peter grinned good-naturedly. He is quite used to being
    laughed at for always running away, and he doesn't mind it in
    the least.</p>

    <p>"When danger's near, who runs away will live to run another
    day," retorted Peter promptly. Then he began the maddest kind
    of a frolic with the Merry Little Breezes until they and he
    were quite tired out and ready for a good rest.</p>

    <p>"I wish," said Peter, as he stretched himself out in the
    middle of the patch of sweet clover, "that you would tell me
    why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries."</p>

    <p>"And we wish that you would tell us the same thing," cried
    one of the Merry Little Breezes.</p>

    <p>"But I can't," protested Peter. "Everybody else seems to
    hurry, at times anyway, but Jimmy never does. He says it is a
    waste of energy, whatever that means."</p>

    <p>"I tell you what&mdash;let's go over to the Smiling Pool and
    ask Grandfather Frog about it now. He'll be sure to know,"
    spoke up one of the Merry Little Breezes.</p>

    <p>"All right," replied Peter, hopping to his feet. "But you'll
    have to ask him. I've asked him for so many stories that I
    don't dare ask for another right away, for fear that he will
    say that I am a nuisance."</p>

    <p>So it was agreed that the Merry Little Breezes should ask
    Grandfather Frog why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries, and
    that Peter should keep out of sight until Grandfather Frog had
    begun the story, for they were sure that there would be a
    story. Away they all hurried to the Smiling Pool. The Merry
    Little Breezes raced so hard that they were quite out of breath
    when they burst through the bulrushes and surrounded
    Grandfather Frog, as he sat on his big green lily-pad.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Grandfather Frog, why is it that Jimmy Skunk never
    hurries?" they panted.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" replied Grandfather Frog in his deepest,
    gruffest voice. "Chug-a-rum! Probably because he has learned
    better."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said one of the Merry Little Breezes, in a rather
    faint, disappointed sort of voice. Just then he spied a fat,
    foolish, green fly and blew it right over to Grandfather Frog,
    who snapped it up in a flash. Right away all the Merry Little
    Breezes began to hunt for foolish green flies and blow them
    over to Grandfather Frog, until he didn't have room for another
    one inside his white and yellow waistcoat. Indeed the legs of
    the last one he tried to swallow stuck out of one corner of his
    big mouth.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog, trying very hard to get
    those legs out of sight. "Chug-a-rum! I always like to do
    something for those who do something for me, and I suppose now
    that I ought to tell you why it is that Jimmy Skunk never
    hurries. I would, if Peter Rabbit were here. If I tell you the
    story, Peter will be sure to hear of it, and then he will give
    me no peace until I tell it to him, and I don't like to tell
    stories twice."</p>

    <p>"But he is here!" cried one of the Little Breezes. "He's
    right over behind that little clump of tall grass."</p>

    <p>"Humph! I thought he wasn't very far away," grunted
    Grandfather Frog, with a twinkle in his great, goggly eyes.</p>

    <p>Peter crept out of his hiding-place, looking rather
    shamefaced and very foolish. Then the Merry Little Breezes
    settled themselves on the lily-pads in a big circle around
    Grandfather Frog, and Peter sat down as close to the edge of
    the bank of the Smiling Pool as he dared to get. After what
    seemed to them a very long time, Grandfather Frog swallowed the
    legs of the last foolish green fly, opened his big mouth, and
    began:</p>

    <p>"Of course you all know that long, long ago, when the world
    was young, things were very different from what they are now,
    very different indeed. The great-great-ever-so-great
    grandfather of Jimmy Skunk was slimmer and trimmer than Jimmy
    is. He was more like his cousins, Mr. Weasel and Mr. Mink. He
    was just as quick moving as they were. Yes, Sir, Mr. Skunk was
    very lively on his feet. He had to be to keep out of the way of
    his big neighbors, for in those days he didn't have any means
    of protecting himself, as Jimmy has now. He was dressed all in
    black. You know it wasn't until Old Mother Nature found out
    that he was taking advantage of that black suit to get into
    mischief on dark nights that she gave him white stripes, so
    that the darker the night, the harder it would be for him to
    keep from being seen.</p>

    <p>"Now Mr. Skunk was very smart and shrewd, oh, very! When the
    hard times came, which made so many changes in the lives of the
    people who lived in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows,
    Mr. Skunk was very quick to see that unless he could think of
    some way to protect himself, it was only a matter of time when
    he would furnish a dinner for one of his fierce big neighbors,
    and of course Mr. Skunk had no desire to do that. It was then
    that he asked Old Mother Nature to give him a bag of perfume so
    strong that it would make everybody ill but himself. Mother
    Nature thought it all over, and then she did, but she made him
    promise that he would never use it unless he was in great
    danger.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Skunk had to try his new defence only once or twice
    before his enemies took the greatest care to let him alone. He
    found that he no longer had to run for a safe hiding-place when
    he met Mr. Wolf or Mr. Lynx or Mr. Panther. They just snarled
    at him and passed without offering to touch him. So Mr. Skunk
    grew very independent and went where he pleased when he
    pleased. And, because he no longer had to run from his enemies,
    he got out of the habit of running. Then he made a discovery.
    He watched those of his neighbors who were forever hurrying
    about looking for food, hurrying because all the time there was
    great fear upon them that an enemy might be near, hurrying
    because each was fearful that his neighbor would get more than
    he. It wasn't long before Mr. Skunk saw that in their hurry
    they overlooked a great deal. In fact, by just following after
    them slowly, he found all he wanted to eat.</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Skunk began to grow fat. His neighbors, who were
    having hard work to make a living, grew envious, and said
    unkind things about him, and hinted that he must be stealing,
    or he never could have so much to eat. But Mr. Skunk didn't
    mind. He went right on about his business. He never worried,
    because, you know, he feared nobody. And he never hurried,
    because he found that it paid best to go slowly. In that way he
    never missed any of the good things that his hurrying, worrying
    neighbors did. So he grew fatter and fatter, while others grew
    thinner. After a while he almost forgot how to run. Being fat
    and never hurrying or worrying made him good-natured. He kept
    right on minding his own affairs and never meddling in the
    affairs of others, so that by and by his neighbors began to
    respect him.</p>

    <p>"Of course he taught his children to do as he did, and they
    taught their children. And so, ever since that long-ago day,
    when the world was young, that little bag of perfume has been
    handed down in the Skunk family, and none of them has ever been
    afraid. Now you know why Jimmy Skunk, whom you all know, is so
    independent and never hurries."</p>

    <p>"Thank you! Thank you, Grandfather Frog!" cried the Merry
    Little Breezes. "When you want some more foolish green flies,
    just let us know, and we'll get them for you."</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! What are you looking so wistful for, Peter
    Rabbit?" demanded Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I was just wishing that I had a&mdash;" began
    Peter. Then suddenly he made a face. "No, I don't either!" he
    declared. "I guess I'd better be getting home to the dear Old
    Briar-patch now. Mrs. Peter probably thinks something has
    happened to me." And away he went, lipperty-lipperty-lip.</p>

    <h3>WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT</h3>

    <p>Sammy Jay has a very fine coat, a very beautiful coat.
    Everybody knows that. In fact, Sammy's coat has long been the
    envy of a great many of his neighbors in the Green Forest. Some
    of them, you know, have very modest coats. They are not
    beautiful at all. And yet the owners of some of these plain
    coats are among the most honest and hard-working of all the
    little people who live in the Green Forest. They find it hard,
    very hard indeed, to understand why such a scamp and
    mischiefmaker as Sammy Jay should be given such a wonderful
    blue coat with white trimmings.</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit often had thought about it. He has a number of
    feathered friends whom he likes ever so much better than he
    does Sammy Jay. In fact, he and Sammy are forever falling out,
    because Sammy delights to tease Peter. He sometimes makes up
    for it by warning Peter when Granny or Reddy Fox happens to be
    about, and Peter is honest enough to recognize this and put it
    to Sammy's credit. But in spite of this, it never seemed to him
    quite right that Sammy Jay should be so handsomely dressed.</p>

    <p>"Of course," said Peter to Grandfather Frog, "Old Mother
    Nature knows a great deal more than I do&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Really! You don't mean to say so! Chug-a-rum! You don't
    mean to say so, Peter!" interrupted Grandfather Frog,
    pretending to be very much surprised at what Peter said.</p>

        <h4>"You don't mean to say so, Peter," interrupted
        Grandfather Frog.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>Peter grinned and wrinkled his nose at Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said he, "Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more
    than I do, but it seems to me as if she had made a mistake in
    giving Sammy Jay such a handsome coat. There must be a reason,
    I suppose, but for the life of me I cannot understand it. I
    should think that she would give such a thief as Sammy Jay the
    very homeliest suit she could find. You may depend I would, if
    I were in her place."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog chuckled until he shook all over.</p>

    <p>"It's lucky for some of us that you are not in her place!"
    said he. "Chug-a-rum! It certainly is lucky!"</p>

    <p>"If I were, I would give you a handsome coat, too,
    Grandfather Frog," replied Peter.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog suddenly swelled out with indignation.
    "Chug-a-rum! Chug-a-rum! What's the matter with the coat I have
    got, Peter Rabbit? Tell me that! Who's got a handsomer one?"
    Grandfather Frog glared with his great, goggly eyes at
    Peter.</p>

    <p>"I didn't mean to say that you haven't got a handsome coat.
    Your coat <i>is</i> handsome, very handsome indeed, Grandfather
    Frog," Peter hastened to say. "I always did like green. I just
    love it! And I should think you would be ever so proud of your
    white and yellow waistcoat. I would if it were mine. What I
    meant to say is, that if I were in Old Mother Nature's place, I
    would give some plain folks handsome suits. Certainly, I
    wouldn't give such a rascal as Sammy Jay one of the handsomest
    coats in all the Green Forest. Knowing Sammy as well as I do,
    it is hard work to believe that he came by it honestly."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog chuckled way down deep in his throat.</p>

    <p>"Sammy came by it honestly enough, Peter. Yes, Sir, he came
    by it honestly enough, because it was handed down to him by his
    father, who got it from his father, who got it from his father,
    and so on, way back to the days when the world was young,
    but&mdash;" Grandfather Frog paused, and that dreamy, far-away
    look which Peter had seen so often came into his great, goggly
    eyes.</p>

    <p>"But what, Grandfather Frog?" asked Peter eagerly, when he
    could keep still no longer.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog settled himself comfortably on his big
    green lily-pad and looked very hard at Peter.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to tell you a story, Peter Rabbit," said he, "so
    that never again will you be led to doubt that Old Mother
    Nature knows exactly what she is about. In the first place,
    Sammy Jay is not wholly to blame for all his bad habits. Some
    of them were handed down to him with his fine coat, just the
    same as your troublesome curiosity was handed down to you with
    the white patch on the seat of your trousers."</p>

    <p>Peter nodded. He had felt a great many times that he just
    couldn't help this habit of poking that wobbly little nose of
    his in where it had no business to be, any more than he could
    change that funny little bunch of white cotton, which he called
    a tail, for a really, truly tail.</p>

    <p>"Of course, you have heard all about what a very fine
    gentleman Sammy Jay's great-great-ever-so-great grandfather was
    thought to be until it was discovered that he was all the time
    stealing from his neighbors and putting the blame on others,
    and how Old Mother Nature punished him by taking away the
    beautiful voice of which he was so proud, and giving him
    instead the harsh voice which Sammy has now, and making him
    tell just what he is by screaming 'thief, thief, thief!' every
    time he opens his mouth to speak.</p>

    <p>"At first Old Mother Nature had intended to take away the
    fine coat of which Mr. Jay was so proud, but when he discovered
    that he had lost his fine voice, he was so ashamed that he
    hurried away to hide himself from the eyes of his neighbors, so
    that Old Mother Nature didn't have time to change his coat just
    then.</p>

    <p>'I'll wait a bit,' said she to herself, 'and see how he
    behaves. Perhaps he is truly sorry for what he has done, and I
    will not have to punish him more.'</p>

    <p>"But if Mr. Jay was truly sorry, he gave no signs of it. You
    see, he had cheated his neighbors, and had stolen from them for
    so long, that he found this the easiest way to get a living.
    His bad habits had become fixed, as bad habits have a way of
    doing. Besides, right down in his heart, he wasn't sorry for
    what he had done, only angry at having been found out. Now that
    he had been found out, of course every one was on the watch for
    him, and it wasn't so easy to steal as it had been before. So
    now, instead of going about openly, with his head held high, he
    grew very crafty, and sneaked quietly about through the Green
    Forest, trying to keep out of sight, that he might the easier
    steal from his neighbors and make trouble for them.</p>

    <p>"When Old Mother Nature saw this, she changed her mind about
    taking away his handsome suit. 'If I do that,' thought she, 'it
    will make it all the easier for him to keep out of sight, and
    all the harder for his neighbors to know when he is about.'</p>

    <p>"So instead of giving him the plain, homely suit that she
    had thought of giving him, she made his coat of blue brighter
    than before and trimmed it with the whitest of white trimmings,
    so that Mr. Jay had one of the very handsomest coats in all the
    Green Forest. At first he was very proud of it, but it wasn't
    long before he found that it was very hard work to keep out of
    sight when he wanted to. That bright blue coat was forever
    giving him away when he was out on mischief. Everybody was all
    the time on the watch for it, and so where in the past Mr. Jay
    had been able, without any trouble, to steal all he wanted to
    eat, now he sometimes actually had to work for his food, and
    get it honestly or else go hungry.</p>

    <p>"You would suppose that he would have mended him ways,
    wouldn't you?"</p>

    <p>Peter nodded.</p>

    <p>"But he didn't. He grew more sly and crafty than ever. But
    in spite of this, he didn't begin to make as much trouble as
    before. He couldn't, you know, because of his bright coat. When
    Old Mother Nature found that Mr. Jay had passed along his bad
    habits to his children, she passed along his handsome blue
    coat, too, and so it has been from that long-ago day right down
    to this. Sammy Jay's fine coat isn't a reward for goodness, as
    is Winsome Bluebird's, but is to help the other little people
    of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows to protect
    themselves, and keep track of Sammy when he is sneaking and
    snooping around looking for mischief. Now what do you think,
    Peter Rabbit?"</p>

    <p>Peter scratched one long ear and then the other long ear
    thoughtfully, and he looked a wee bit ashamed as he replied: "I
    guess Old Mother Nature makes no mistakes and always knows just
    what she is doing."</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest voice.
    "You may be sure she does. And another thing, Peter Rabbit:
    Never judge any one by his clothes. It is a great mistake, a
    very great mistake. Plain clothes sometimes cover the kindest
    hearts, and fine clothes often are a warning to beware of
    mischief."</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I don't know but you are right," admitted
    Peter.</p>

    <p>"I know I am," said Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <h3>WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER</h3>

    <p>Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck had gone down to the Smiling
    Pool for a call on their old friend, Jerry Muskrat. But Jerry
    was nowhere to be seen. They waited and waited, but no Jerry
    Muskrat.</p>

    <p>"Probably he is taking a nap in that big house of his," said
    Johnny Chuck, "and if he is we'll have to sit here until he
    wakes up, or else go back home and visit him some other
    time."</p>

    <p>"That's so," replied Peter. "I don't see what he has his
    house in the water for, anyway. If he had built it on land,
    like sensible people, we might be able to waken him. Funny
    place to build a house, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully. "It does seem
    a funny place," he admitted. "It certainly does seem a funny
    place. But then, Jerry Muskrat is a funny fellow. You know how
    much of the time he stays in the water. That seems funny to me.
    I suppose there is a reason for it, and probably there is a
    reason for building his house where it is. I've found that
    there is a reason for most things. Probably Jerry's
    great-great-grandfather built his house that way, and so Jerry
    does the same thing."</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit suddenly brightened up. "I do believe you are
    right, Johnny Chuck, and if you are, there must be a story
    about it, and if there is a story, Grandfather Frog will be
    sure to know it. There he is, over on his big green lily-pad,
    and he looks as if he might be feeling very good-natured this
    morning. Let's go ask him why Jerry Muskrat builds his house in
    the water."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog saw them coming, and he guessed right away
    that they were coming for a story. He grinned to himself and
    pretended to go to sleep.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, Grandfather Frog," said Johnny Chuck.
    Grandfather Frog didn't answer. Johnny tried again, and still
    no reply.</p>

    <p>"He's asleep," said Johnny, looking dreadfully disappointed,
    "and I guess we'd better not disturb him, for he might wake up
    cross, and of course we wouldn't get a story if he did."</p>

    <p>Peter looked at Grandfather Frog sharply. He wasn't so sure
    that that was a real nap. It seemed to him that there was just
    the least little hint of a smile in the corners of Grandfather
    Frog's big mouth. "You sit here a minute," he whispered in
    Johnny Chuck's ear.</p>

    <p>So Johnny Chuck sat down where he was, which was right where
    Grandfather Frog could see him by lifting one eyelid just the
    teeniest bit, and Peter hopped along the bank until he was
    right behind Grandfather Frog. Now just at that place on the
    bank was growing a toadstool. Peter looked over at Johnny Chuck
    and winked. Then he turned around, and with one of his long
    hind-feet, he kicked the toadstool with all his might. Now
    toadstools, as you all know, are not very well fastened at the
    roots, and this one was no different from the rest. When Peter
    kicked it it flew out into the air and landed with a great
    splash in the Smiling Pool, close beside the big green lily-pad
    on which Grandfather Frog was sitting. Of course he didn't see
    it coming, and of course it gave him a great start.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" exclaimed Grandfather Frog and dived head
    first into the water. A minute later Peter's sharp eyes saw him
    peeping out from under a lily-pad to see what had frightened
    him so.</p>

    <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" shouted Peter, dancing about on the bank. "Ha,
    ha, ha! Grandfather Frog, afraid of a toadstool! Ha, ha,
    ha!"</p>

    <p>At first Grandfather Frog was angry, very angry indeed. But
    he is too old and too wise to lose his temper for long over a
    joke, especially when he has been fairly caught trying to play
    a joke himself. So presently he climbed back on to his big
    green lily-pad, blinking his great, goggly eyes and looking
    just a wee bit foolish.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! I might have known that that was some of your
    work, Peter Rabbit," said he, "but I thought it surely was a
    stone thrown by Farmer Brown's boy. What do you mean by
    frightening an old fellow like me this way?"</p>

    <p>"Just trying to get even with you for trying to fool us into
    thinking that you were asleep when you were wide awake,"
    replied Peter. "Oh, Grandfather Frog, do tell us why it is that
    Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water. Please do!"</p>

    <p>"I have a mind not to, just to get even with you," said
    Grandfather Frog, settling himself comfortably, "but I believe
    I will, to show you that there are some folks who can take a
    joke without losing their temper."</p>

    <p>"Goody!" cried Peter and Johnny Chuck together, sitting down
    side by side on the very edge of the bank.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog folded his hands across his white and
    yellow waistcoat and half closed his eyes, as if looking way,
    way back into the past.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" he began. "A long, long time ago, when the
    world was young, there was very little dry land, and most of
    the animals lived in the water. Yes, Sir, most of the animals
    lived in the water, as sensible animals do to-day."</p>

    <p>Peter nudged Johnny Chuck. "He means himself and his
    family," he whispered with a chuckle.</p>

    <p>"After a time," continued Grandfather Frog, "there began to
    be more land and still more. Then some of the animals began to
    spend most of their time on the land. As there got to be more
    and more land, more and more of the animals left the water,
    until finally most of them were spending nearly all of the time
    on land. Now Old Mother Nature had been keeping a sharp watch,
    as she always does, and when she found that they were foolish
    enough to like the land best, she did all that she could to
    make things comfortable for them. She taught them how to run
    and jump and climb and dig, according to which things they
    liked best to do, so that it wasn't very long before a lot of
    them forgot that they ever had lived in the water, and they
    began to look down on those who still lived in the water, and
    to put on airs and hold their heads very high.</p>

    <p>"Now, of course, Old Mother Nature didn't like this, and to
    punish them she said that they should no longer be able to live
    in the water, even if they wanted to. At first they only
    laughed, but after a while they found that quite often there
    were times when it would be very nice to be at home in the
    water as they once had been. But it was of no use. Some could
    swim as long as they could keep their heads above water, but as
    soon as they put their heads under water they were likely to
    drown. You know that is the way with you to-day, Peter
    Rabbit."</p>

    <p>Peter nodded. He knew that he could swim if he had to, but
    only for a very little way, and he hated the thought of it.</p>

    <p>"Now there were a few animals, of whom old Mr. Muskrat, the
    grandfather a thousand times removed of Jerry Muskrat, was one,
    who learned to walk and run on dry land, but who still loved
    the water," continued Grandfather Frog. "One day Old Mother
    Nature found Mr. Muskrat sitting on a rock, looking very
    mournful.</p>

    <p>"'What's the matter, Mr. Muskrat?' she asked.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Muskrat looked very much ashamed as he finally owned up
    that he was envious of his cousins and some of the other
    animals, because they had such fine houses on the land.</p>

    <p>"'Then why don't you build you a fine house on the land?'
    asked Old Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Muskrat hesitated. 'I&mdash;I&mdash;love the water too
    well to want to stay on land all the time,' said he,
    'and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I was put in the water in the first
    place, and I ought to be contented with what I have got and
    make the best of it.'</p>

    <p>"Old Mother Nature was so pleased with Mr. Muskrat's reply
    that right away she made up her mind that he should have a
    finer house than any of the others, so she took him over to a
    quiet little pool, where the water was not too deep and she
    showed him how to build a wonderful house of mud and rushes and
    twigs, with a nice warm bedroom lined with grass above the
    water, and an entrance down under the water, so that no one
    except those who still lived most of the time in the water
    could possibly get into it. None of his friends on land had
    such a big, fine house, and Mr. Muskrat was very proud of it.
    But with all his pride he never forgot that it was a reward for
    trying to be content with his surroundings and making the best
    of them.</p>

    <p>"So from that day to this, the Muskrats have built their
    houses in the water, and have been among the most industrious,
    contented, and happy of all the animals. And that is why Jerry
    Muskrat has built that fine house in the Smiling Pool and has
    so few enemies," concluded Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit drew a long breath, which was almost a sigh. "I
    almost wish my grandfather a thousand times removed had been
    content to stay in the water, too," he said.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" retorted Grandfather Frog. "If he had, you
    wouldn't have the dear Old Briar-patch. Be content with what
    you've got,"</p>

    <p>"I think I will," said Peter.</p>

    <h2><a name="VIII"
       id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

    <h3>WHY OLD MAN COYOTE HAS MANY VOICES</h3>

    <p>Of course Old Man Coyote has only one voice, but that one is
    such a wonderful voice that he can make it sound like a great
    many voices, all yelping and howling and shouting and laughing
    at the same time. So those who hear him always say that he has
    many voices, and that certainly is the way it seems. The first
    time Peter Rabbit heard Old Man Coyote, he was sure, absolutely
    sure, that there was a whole crowd of strangers on the Green
    Meadows, and you may be sure that he kept very close to his
    dear Old Briar-patch. If you had been there and tried to tell
    Peter that all that noise was made by just one voice, he
    wouldn't have believed you. No, Sir, he wouldn't have believed
    you. And you couldn't have blamed him.</p>

    <p>It was the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind who
    first told Peter who the stranger was and warned him to watch
    out, because Old Man Coyote is just as fond of Rabbit as Granny
    or Reddy Fox, and is even more crafty and sly than they. Peter
    thanked the Merry Little Breezes for the warning, and then he
    asked them how many of his family Old Man Coyote had brought
    with him. Of course the Merry Little Breezes told Peter that
    Old Man Coyote was all alone, and they became very indignant
    when Peter laughed at them. He just couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>"Why," said he, "every night I hear a whole crowd yelping
    and howling together."</p>

    <p>"But you don't!" insisted the Merry Little Breezes. "It is
    Old Man Coyote alone who makes all that noise."</p>

    <p>"Don't you suppose I know what I hear?" demanded Peter.</p>

    <p>"No!" retorted the Merry Little Breezes. "You may have big
    ears and be able to hear a great deal, sometimes a great deal
    more than you have any business to hear, but you are old enough
    by this time to have learned that you cannot believe all you
    hear." And with that the Merry Little Breezes indignantly raced
    away to spread the news all over the Green Meadows.</p>

    <p>Now Peter was quite as indignant because they thought he
    couldn't or shouldn't believe his own ears, as they were
    because he wouldn't believe what they told him, and all the
    rest of that day he couldn't put the matter out of his mind. He
    was still thinking of it as the Black Shadows came creeping
    down from the Purple Hills across the Green Meadows. Suddenly
    Peter saw a dark form skulking among the Black Shadows. At
    first he thought it was Reddy Fox, only somehow it looked
    bigger. Peter, safe in the dear Old Briar-patch, watched.
    Presently the dark form came out from among the Black Shadows
    where Peter could see it clearly, sat down, pointed a sharp
    nose up at the first twinkling little stars, opened a big
    mouth, and out of it poured such a yelping and howling as made
    Peter shiver with fright. And now Peter had to believe his eyes
    rather than his ears. His ears told him that there were many
    voices, but his eyes told him that all that dreadful sound was
    coming out of one mouth. It was hard, very hard, to believe,
    but it was so.</p>

    <p>"The Merry Little Breezes were right," muttered Peter to
    himself, as Old Man Coyote trotted away in the direction of the
    Green Forest, and he felt a wee bit ashamed to think that he
    had refused to believe them.</p>

    <p>After that, Peter could think of nothing but Old Man
    Coyote's wonderful voice that sounded like many voices, and at
    the very first opportunity he hurried over to the Smiling Pool
    to ask Grandfather Frog what it meant.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog. "It means simply that
    Old Man Coyote comes of a very smart family, and that he knows
    how to make the most of the gift of Old Mother Nature to his
    grandfather a thousand times removed."</p>

    <p>This sounded so much like a story that Peter straightway
    teased Grandfather Frog to tell him all about it. At last, to
    get rid of him and enjoy a little quiet and peace, Grandfather
    Frog did so.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" he began, as he always does. "The
    great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Old Man Coyote, who
    lived long, long ago when the world was young, was very much as
    Old Man Coyote is to-day. He was just as smart and just as
    clever. Indeed, he was smart enough and clever enough not to
    let his neighbors know that he was smart and clever at all.
    Those were very peaceful times at first, and everybody was on
    the best of terms with everybody else, as you know. There was
    plenty to eat without the trouble to steal, and everybody was
    honest simply because it was easier to be honest than it was to
    be dishonest. So Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest, and
    everybody was happy and contented.</p>

    <p>"But there came a time when food was scarce, and it was no
    longer easy to get plenty to eat. It was then that the stronger
    began to steal from the weaker, and by and by even to prey upon
    those smaller than themselves. The times grew harder and
    harder, and because hunger is a hard and cruel master, it made
    the larger and stronger people hard and cruel, too. Some of
    them it made very sly and cunning, like old Mr. Fox. Mr. Coyote
    was another whom it made sly and cunning. He was smart in the
    first place, even smarter than Mr. Fox, and he very early made
    up his mind that if he would live, it must be by his wits, for
    he wasn't big enough or strong enough to fight with his
    neighbors such as his big cousin, Mr. Timber Wolf, or Mr. Lynx,
    or Mr. Panther or Old King Bear, who was king no longer. And
    yet he liked the same things to eat.</p>

    <p>"So he used to study and plan how he could outwit them
    without danger to himself. 'A whole skin is better than a full
    stomach, but both a whole skin and a full stomach are better
    still,' said he to himself; as he thought and schemed. For a
    while he was content to catch what he could without danger to
    himself, and to eat what his bigger and stronger neighbors left
    when they happened to get more than they wanted for themselves.
    Little by little he got the habit of slyly following them when
    they were hunting, always keeping out of sight. In this way, he
    managed to get many meals of scraps. But these scraps never
    wholly satisfied him, and his mouth used to water as he watched
    the others feast on the very best when they had had a
    successful hunt. He knew it wouldn't be of the least use to go
    out and boldly ask for some, for in those hard times everybody
    was very, very selfish.</p>

    <p>"The times grew harder and harder, until it seemed as if Old
    Mother Nature had wholly forgotten her little people of the
    Green Meadows and the Green Forest. Mr. Coyote still managed to
    pick up a living, but he was hungry most of the time, and the
    less he had to put in his stomach, the sharper his wits grew.
    At last one day, as he stole soft-footed through the Green
    Forest, he discovered Mr. Lynx having a great feast. To keep
    still and watch him was almost more than Mr. Coyote could
    stand, for he was so hungry that it seemed as if the sides of
    his stomach almost met, it was so empty.</p>

    <p>"'If I could make myself into three, we could take that
    dinner away from Mr. Lynx!" thought he, and right on top of
    that thought came a great idea. Why not make Mr. Lynx think he
    had a lot of friends with him? It would do no harm to try. So
    Mr. Coyote put his nose up in the air and howled. Mr. Lynx
    looked up and grinned. He had no fear of Mr. Coyote. Then Mr.
    Coyote hurried around to the other side of Mr. Lynx, all the
    time keeping out of sight, and howled again, and this time he
    tried to make his voice sound different. Mr. Lynx stopped
    eating and looked up a little surprised. 'I wonder if Mr.
    Coyote has got a brother with him,' thought he. A minute later
    Mr. Coyote howled again from the place where he had howled in
    the first place. 'He certainly has,' thought Mr. Lynx, 'but I'm
    a match for two of them,' and once more he went on eating.</p>

    <p>"Then Mr. Coyote began to run in a circle around Mr. Lynx,
    always keeping out of sight in the thick brush, and every few
    steps he yelped or howled, and each yelp or howl he tried to
    make sound different. Now Mr. Coyote could run very fast, and
    he ran now as hard as ever he could in a big circle, yelping
    and howling and making his voice sound as different as possible
    each time. Mr. Lynx grew anxious and lost his appetite. 'Mr.
    Coyote must have a whole crowd of brothers,' thought he. 'I
    guess this is no place for me!' With that he started to sneak
    away.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Coyote followed him, still trying to make his voice
    sound like the voices of many. Mr. Lynx gave a hurried look
    over his shoulder and began to run. Mr. Coyote kept after him,
    yelping and howling, until he was sure that Mr. Lynx was so
    frightened that he wouldn't dare come back. Then Mr. Coyote
    returned to the dinner Mr. Lynx had left, and ate and ate until
    he couldn't hold another mouthful. His throat was very raw and
    sore because he had strained it trying to make his voice change
    so often, but he didn't mind this, because, you know, it felt
    so good to have all he could eat at one time once more.</p>

    <p>"Now it just happened that Old Mother Nature had come along
    just in time to see and hear Mr. Coyote, and it tickled her so
    to think that Mr. Coyote had been so smart that what do you
    think she did? Why, while he slept that night, she healed his
    sore throat, and she gave him a new voice; and this voice was
    very wonderful, for it sounded for all the world like many
    voices, all yelping and howling at the same time. After that,
    all Mr. Coyote had to do when he wanted to frighten some one
    bigger and stronger than himself was to open his mouth and send
    forth his new voice, which sounded like many voices.</p>

    <p>"So he had plenty to eat from that time on. And all his
    children and his children's children had that same wonderful
    voice, just as Old Man Coyote has now. Chug-a-rum! Now scamper
    home, Peter Rabbit, and see that you don't let Old Man Coyote's
    sharp wits get you into trouble."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Grandfather Frog!" cried Peter and scampered as
    fast as he could go for the dear, safe Old Briar-patch.</p>

    <h3>WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND</h3>

    <p>Striped Chipmunk sat staring at a little ridge where the
    grass was raised up. He had often seen little ridges like that
    without thinking much about them. He knew that they were made
    by Miner the Mole. He had known that ever since he was big
    enough to begin to ask questions. But now as he looked at this
    one, it suddenly struck him that he had not seen Miner the Mole
    more than once or twice in all his life.</p>

    <p>"What a queer way of living!" thought Striped Chipmunk.
    "It's all very well to have a snug house under the ground,
    where one can sleep the long cold winter away and be perfectly
    safe, but what any one wants to live under the ground all the
    time for, in the beautiful springtime and summertime and
    autumntime, I can't understand. Just think of all that Miner
    misses&mdash;the sunshine, the flowers, the songs of the birds,
    and the Merry Little Breezes to play with! I wonder&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What do you wonder?" The voice was so close to Striped
    Chipmunk that it made him jump. He whirled about. There was
    Johnny Chuck, who had tiptoed up as softly as he knew how, to
    give Striped Chipmunk a scare. Johnny grinned. "What do you
    wonder?" he repeated.</p>

    <p>Striped Chipmunk made a face at Johnny. "I wonder something
    that I bet you don't know," he replied.</p>

    <p>"That's easy," replied Johnny. "There are more things I
    don't know than I do know, but I'm always ready to learn. What
    is it this time?"</p>

    <p>"Why does Miner the Mole live under ground all the time?"
    Striped Chipmunk pointed to the ridge made by Miner.</p>

    <p>Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>"I don't know," he confessed finally. "I never thought of it
    before. Of course there must be a reason. He never comes out to
    play with the rest of us&mdash;just spends all his time by
    himself down in the dark, digging and digging. I
    wonder&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Well, what do <i>you</i> wonder?"</p>

    <p>"The same thing you wonder," laughed Johnny Chuck. "If you
    haven't got anything else to do, let's go down to the Smiling
    Pool and ask Grandfather Frog; he'll be sure to know."</p>

    <p>Striped Chipmunk hadn't anything else to do, so off they
    started. On the way they met Jimmy Skunk and Danny Meadow
    Mouse. Neither of them knew why Miner the Mole lives under
    ground, and because they hadn't anything better to do, they
    also started for the Smiling Pool.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog was sitting on his big green lily-pad in
    the warm sunshine, and for once he didn't have to be teased for
    a story.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said he in his deep voice. "It's very strange
    to me how little some folks know about their nearest
    neighbors." He looked up and winked at jolly, round, bright Mr.
    Sun.</p>

    <p>Striped Chipmunk, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, and Danny
    Meadow Mouse looked as though they felt very foolish, as indeed
    they did. You see, all their lives Miner the Mole had been one
    of their nearest neighbors, and yet they didn't know the first
    thing about him.</p>

    <p>"It happened a long time ago," continued Grandfather
    Frog.</p>

    <p>"When the world was young?" interrupted Danny Meadow
    Mouse.</p>

    <p>"Of course," replied Grandfather Frog, pretending to be very
    much put out at such a foolish question. Danny hung his head
    and resolved that he would bite his tongue before he asked
    another question.</p>

    <p>"In those days Miner's great-great-grandfather a thousand
    times removed didn't live under ground," continued Grandfather
    Frog. "Nobody did. He wasn't so very different from a lot of
    other animals. Food was plenty, and everybody was on the best
    of terms with everybody else. Mr. Mole lived just as the rest
    did. He went and came as he pleased, and enjoyed the sunshine
    and took part in all the good times of his neighbors. Everybody
    liked him, and whenever he made a call, he was sure of a
    welcome. But one thing Mr. Mole never did; he never meddled in
    other people's affairs. No, Sir, Mr. Mole never poked his nose
    in where he had no business.</p>

    <p>"For a long time everything went smoothly with all the
    people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows. Then came
    hard times. They grew harder and harder. Food was scarce and
    kept growing more scarce. Everybody was hungry, and you know
    how it is with hungry people&mdash;they grow ugly and
    quarrelsome. Matters grew worse and worse, and then it was that
    fear was born. The big people, like Old King Bear and Mr. Wolf
    and Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx, began to look with hungry eyes on
    the little people, and the little people began to grow afraid
    and hide from the big people, and all the time they were
    continually quarreling among themselves and stealing from each
    other to get enough to eat.</p>

    <p>"Now, as I said before, Mr. Mole never had meddled with
    other people's business, and he didn't now. He went off by
    himself to think things over. 'It isn't safe to run around any
    more,' said he. 'I met Mr. Wolf this morning, and he looked at
    me with such a hungry look in his eyes that it gave me the cold
    shivers. I believe he would have eaten me, if I hadn't crawled
    into an old hollow stump. Now I can't run fast, because my legs
    are too short. I can't climb trees like Mr. Squirrel, and I
    can't swim like Mr. Muskrat. The only thing I can do is to
    dig.'</p>

    <p>"You see, Mr. Mole always had been very fond of digging, and
    he had done so much of it that his front legs and claws had
    grown very stout.</p>

    <p>"'Now if I dig a hole and keep out of sight, I won't have to
    worry about Mr. Wolf or anybody else,' continued Mr. Mole to
    himself. So he went to work at once and dug a hole on the Green
    Meadows, and, because he wanted to be comfortable, he made a
    big hole. When it was finished, he was tired, so he curled up
    at the bottom for a nap. He was awakened by hearing voices
    outside. He knew those voices right away. They were the voices
    of Mr. Fox and Mr. Badger.</p>

    <p>"'These are terrible times,' said Mr. Fox. 'I'm so hungry
    that I'm wasting away to a shadow. I wonder who has dug this
    hole.'</p>

    <p>"'Mr. Mole,' replied Mr. Badger. 'I saw him at work here
    this morning.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed how very plump he looks?'</p>

    <p>"'Yes,' replied Mr. Fox. 'He made my mouth water the very
    last time I saw him. Seems to me I can smell him now. If he had
    made this hole just a little bit bigger I would go down and
    pull him out, but I am too tired to do any digging now.'</p>

    <p>"'I tell you what,' replied Mr. Badger. 'We'll hunt together
    a little longer, and then if we can't find anything to eat,
    we'll come back, and I'll help you dig, I hate to hurt Mr.
    Mole, because he always minds his own business, but these are
    hard times, and each one must look out for himself.'</p>

    <p>"With that they went away, leaving Mr. Mole shaking with
    fright at the bottom of his hole. 'It's of no use,' thought Mr.
    Mole. 'If I go outside, they will soon find me, and if I stay
    here, they will dig me out. Oh, dear, oh, dear! What ever can I
    do?'</p>

    <p>"He lay there feeling very helpless and miserable, when all
    of a sudden a thought came to him. If he had made his hole
    small, just big enough for him to crawl into, Mr. Badger and
    Mr. Fox would have had to do a great deal of digging to make it
    big enough for either of them to get in! He would make a little
    tunnel off one side and hide in that. So he went to work and
    made a little tunnel off one side just big enough for him to
    squeeze into. He worked very hard and very fast, and by the
    time Mr. Badger and Mr. Fox returned, Mr. Mole was at the end
    of a long tunnel, so far from the hole he had first dug that he
    knew it would take them a long time to dig him out, even if
    they noticed his tunnel.</p>

    <p>"But they didn't. They dug down to the bottom of his hole
    and then, because they didn't find him there, they straightway
    fell to quarreling, each blaming the other for suggesting such
    a lot of hard work for nothing. Finally they went away, still
    calling each other names, and from that day to this, Foxes and
    Badgers have never been friends.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Mole was very thankful for his narrow escape, and it
    set him to thinking. If he had a lot of these underground
    tunnels, no one would be able to catch him. It was a splendid
    idea! He went to work on it at once. And then he made a
    discovery&mdash;such a splendid discovery! There was plenty of
    food to eat right down under ground&mdash;worms and
    grubs&mdash;all he needed. After that, Mr. Mole spent all his
    time in his tunnels and seldom put his nose outside. He was
    safe, and he was comfortable, and he could always find
    something to eat by digging for it.</p>

    <p>"Little by little his old neighbors forgot all about him.
    Because he had little use for them, his eyes grew smaller and
    smaller, and when he did come up into the light, they hurt him
    so that he was glad to go back into the dark again. He was
    perfectly happy and satisfied there, and what is there in life
    better than to be happy and satisfied?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing," replied Striped Chipmunk, at whom Grandfather
    Frog happened to be looking when he asked the question.</p>

    <p>"Right!" replied Grandfather Frog. "And now you know why
    Miner the Mole lives under ground&mdash;because he is perfectly
    happy and satisfied there."</p>

    <p>Just then up came Peter Rabbit, all out of breath.</p>

    <p>"Has Grandfather Frog been telling a story?" he panted.</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied Striped Chipmunk, winking at Grandfather
    Frog, "and now we are going back home perfectly happy and
    satisfied."</p>

    <p>And to this day Peter Rabbit wonders what the story was that
    he missed.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2><a name="X"
       id="X"></a>X</h2>

    <h3>WHY MR. SNAKE CANNOT WINK</h3>

    <p>Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were playing tag on the Green
    Meadows. Of course Peter can run so much faster than Johnny
    Chuck that he would never have been "it" if he had tried his
    best to keep out of the way. But he didn't. No, Sir, Peter
    Rabbit didn't do anything of the kind. He pretended that one of
    his long hind-legs was lame so that he had to run on three
    legs, while Johnny Chuck could use all four. It was great fun.
    They raced and dodged and twisted and turned. Sometimes Peter
    was so excited that he would forget and use all four legs. Then
    Johnny Chuck would shout "No fair!" Peter would say that he
    didn't mean to, and to make up for it would be "it" and try to
    catch Johnny.</p>

    <p>Now it happened that curled up on a little grassy tussock,
    taking an early morning sun-bath, lay little Mr. Greensnake. Of
    course Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were not afraid of him. If
    it had been Mr. Rattlesnake or Mr. Gophersnake, it would have
    been different. But from little Mr. Greensnake there was
    nothing to fear, and sometimes, just for fun, Peter would jump
    right over him. When he did that, Peter always winked
    good-naturedly. But Mr. Greensnake never winked back. Instead
    he would raise his head, run his tongue out at Peter, and hiss
    in what he tried to make a very fierce and angry manner. Then
    Peter would laugh and wink at him again. But never once did Mr.
    Greensnake wink back.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

             name="fig04"

        </a>

        <h4>He would make no reply, save to run out his tongue at
        them.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>Peter was thinking of this as he and Johnny Chuck stretched
    out in a sunny spot to get their breath and rest. He had never
    thought of it before, but now that he had noticed it, he
    couldn't remember that he ever had seen little Mr. Greensnake
    wink, nor any of Mr. Greensnake's relatives. He mentioned the
    matter to Johnny Chuck.</p>

    <p>"That's so," replied Johnny thoughtfully. "I never have seen
    any of them wink, either. Do you suppose they can wink?"</p>

    <p>"Let's go ask Mr. Greensnake," said Peter.</p>

    <p>Up they hopped and raced over to the grassy tussock where
    Mr. Greensnake lay, but to all their questions he would make no
    reply save to run out his tongue at them. Finally they gave up
    asking him.</p>

    <p>"I tell you what, let's go over to the Smiling Pool and ask
    Grandfather Frog. He'll be sure to know, and perhaps, if he is
    feeling good, he'll tell us a story," said Peter.</p>

    <p>So off they scampered to the Smiling Pool. There they found
    Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily-pad just as
    usual, and Peter knew by the look in his great, goggly eyes
    that Grandfather Frog had a good breakfast of foolish green
    flies tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat. His
    eyes twinkled as Peter and Johnny very politely wished him good
    morning.</p>

    <p>"Good morning," said he gruffly.</p>

    <p>But Peter had seen that twinkle in his eyes and knew that
    Grandfather Frog was feeling good-natured in spite of his gruff
    greeting.</p>

    <p>"If you please, Grandfather Frog, why doesn't Mr. Greensnake
    wink at us when we wink at him?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! Because he can't," replied Grandfather
    Frog.</p>

    <p>"Can't!" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck together.</p>

    <p>"That's what I said&mdash;can't," replied Grandfather Frog.
    "And no more can Mr. Blacksnake, or Mr. Rattlesnake, or Mr.
    Gophersnake, or any other member of the Snake family."</p>

    <p>"Why not?" cried Peter and Johnny, all in the same
    breath.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog, folding his hands
    across his white and yellow waistcoat, "if you will sit still
    until I finish, I'll tell you; but if you move or ask any
    foolish questions, I'll stop right where I am, and you'll never
    hear the end of the story, for no one else knows it."</p>

    <p>Of course Peter and Johnny promised to sit perfectly still
    and not say a word. After they had made themselves comfortable,
    Grandfather Frog cleared his throat as if to begin, but for a
    long time he didn't say a word. Once Peter opened his mouth to
    ask why, but remembered in time and closed it again without
    making a sound.</p>

    <p>At last Grandfather Frog cleared his throat once more, and
    with a far-away look in his great, goggly eyes began:</p>

    <p>"Once upon a time, long, long ago, when the world was young,
    lived old Mr. Snake, the grandfather a thousand times removed
    of little Mr. Greensnake and all the other Snakes whom you
    know. Of course he wasn't old then. He was young and spry and
    smart, was Mr. Snake. Now there is such a thing as being too
    smart. That was the trouble with Mr. Snake. Yes, Sir, that was
    the trouble with Mr. Snake. He was so smart that he soon found
    out that he was the smartest of all the meadow and forest
    people, and that was a bad thing. It certainly was a very bad
    thing." Grandfather Frog shook his head gravely.</p>

    <p>"You see," he continued, "as soon as he found that out, he
    began to take advantage of his neighbors and cheat them, but he
    would do it so smoothly that they never once suspected that
    they were being cheated. Mr. Snake would go about all day
    cheating everybody he met. At night he would go home and
    chuckle over his smartness. It wasn't long before he began to
    look down on his neighbors for being so honest that they didn't
    suspect other people of being dishonest, and for being so
    easily cheated.</p>

    <p>"Now one bad habit almost always leads to another. From
    cheating, Mr. Snake just naturally slipped to stealing. Yes,
    Sir, he became a thief. Of course that made trouble right away,
    but still no one suspected Mr. Snake. He was always very polite
    to every one and always offering to do favors for his
    neighbors. In fact, Mr. Snake was very well liked and much
    respected. When any one had been robbed, he was always the
    first to offer sympathy and join in the hunt for the thief. He
    was so spry and slim, and could slip through the tall grass so
    fast, that he could go almost where he pleased without being
    seen, and this made him very bold. If he did happen to be found
    near the scene of trouble, he always had a story ready to
    account for his presence, and it sounded so true, and he told
    it in such an honest manner, that no one thought of doubting
    it.</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Snake found that lying helped him to cheat and
    steal, and all the time he kept thinking how smart he was. But
    even Mr. Snake had a little bit of conscience, and once in a
    while it would trouble him. So what do you think he did? Why,
    cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually
    tried to cheat himself&mdash;to cheat his conscience! When he
    was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to
    himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if these folks are not
    smart enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their
    own fault if they believe what I am telling them.' But always
    he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one
    he was talking to.</p>

    <p>"Dear me, dear me, such terrible times as there were on the
    Green Meadows and in the Green Forest! They grew worse and
    worse, and when at last Old Mother Nature came to see how all
    the little people were getting along, she heard so many
    complaints that she hardly knew where to begin to straighten
    matters out. She had all the little people come before her in
    turn and tell their troubles. When it came Mr. Snake's turn, he
    had no complaint to make. He seemed to be the only one who had
    no troubles. She asked him a great many questions, and for each
    one he had a ready reply. Of course a great many of these
    replies were lies, and every time he told one of these, he
    winked without knowing it. You see, it had become a habit.</p>

    <p>"Now, with all his smartness, Mr. Snake had forgotten one
    thing, one very important thing. It was this: You can't fool
    Old Mother Nature, and it is of no use to try. He hadn't been
    talking three minutes before she knew who was at the bottom of
    all the trouble. She let him finish, then called all the others
    about her and told them who had made all the trouble. Mr. Snake
    was very bold. He held his head very high in the air and
    pretended not to care. When Old Mother Nature turned her head,
    he even ran out his tongue at her, just as all the Snake family
    do at you and me to-day. When she had finished telling them how
    cheating and stealing and lying isn't smart at all, but very,
    very dreadful, she turned to Mr. Snake and said:</p>

    <p>"'From this time on, no one will believe anything you say,
    and you shall have no friends. You will never wink again, for
    you and your children and your children's children forever will
    have no eyelids, that all the world may know that those who
    make a wrong use of the things given them shall have them taken
    away.'</p>

    <p>"And now you know why little Mr. Greensnake cannot wink at
    you; he hasn't any eyelids to wink with" finished Grandfather
    Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit drew a long breath. "Thank you, oh, thank you
    ever so much, Grandfather Frog," he said. "Will you tell us
    next time why Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," replied Grandfather Frog.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2><a name="XI"
       id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

    <h3>WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL</h3>

    <p>Peter Rabbit would give Grandfather Frog no peace. Every day
    Peter visited the Smiling Pool to tease Grandfather Frog for a
    story&mdash;for one particular story. He wanted to know why it
    is that Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail. You see, Peter had
    admired Bobby Coon's tail for a long time. Peter has such a
    funny little tail himself, just a little white bunch of cotton,
    that such a handsome tail as Bobby Coon's sometimes stirs just
    a wee bit of envy in Peter's heart.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't envy so much as curiosity that prompted Peter
    to tease for that story. Bobby Coon's tail is very handsome,
    you know. It has beautiful rings of black and gray, and Peter
    didn't know of any other tail at all like it. Somehow, he felt
    right down deep in his heart that there must be a reason for
    those rings, just as there is a reason for his own long ears
    and long legs. The more he thought about it, the more he felt
    that he simply must know, and the only way he could find out
    was from Grandfather Frog, who is very old and very wise. So he
    teased and he teased until finally Grandfather Frog promised
    him that on the next afternoon he would tell Peter why Bobby
    Coon has rings on his tail. Peter hurried away to tell all the
    little meadow and forest people, and the next afternoon they
    were all on hand on the bank of the Smiling Pool to hear the
    story about Bobby Coon's tail.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" began Grandfather Frog, smoothing down his
    white and yellow waistcoat. "Chug-a-rum! Some folks seem to
    think that what they do doesn't matter to anybody but
    themselves. That was the way with old Mr. Rabbit, who lived a
    long time ago when the world was young. He thought he could
    make all the trouble he pleased by his dreadful curiosity, and
    if he was found out, no one would suffer but himself. But it
    wasn't so. Here is Peter Rabbit, his grandchild a thousand
    times removed, with long legs and long ears, and the bad habit
    of curiosity, all because old Mr. Rabbit had a bad habit and
    didn't try to overcome it.</p>

    <p>"It was the same way with old Mr. Coon. He was dishonest and
    stole from Old King Bear. Old Mother Nature punished him by
    putting mustard in his food, and Mr. Coon thought he was so
    smart that he could get ahead of Old Mother Nature by washing
    all his food before he ate it. Old Mother Nature didn't say
    anything, but watched him and smiled to herself. You see, she
    knew that Mr. Coon was beginning a good habit, a very good
    habit indeed&mdash;the habit of neatness. So, though she knew
    perfectly well that he was doing it just to get ahead of her,
    she was glad, for she was fond of Mr. Coon in spite of the bad
    ways he had grown into, and she knew that good habits are like
    bad habits&mdash;once started they grow and grow, and are very
    likely to lead to more good habits.</p>

    <p>"It was so with Mr. Coon. He found that his food tasted
    better for being so clean, and he grew very fussy about what he
    ate. No matter where he found it or how tempting it looked, he
    wouldn't eat it until he had carried it to the nearest water
    and washed it. He still remembered the mustard and tried to
    fool himself into thinking that he was simply spiting Old
    Mother Nature, but right down in his heart he knew that even if
    he should be told that never again would there be mustard in
    his food, he would wash it just the same.</p>

    <p>"One day, as he sat beside the Laughing Brook eating his
    supper, he noticed that while his food had been washed clean,
    his hands were dirty. They spoiled his supper. Yes, Sir, they
    spoiled his supper.</p>

    <p>"'What good does it do to wash my food, if I eat it out of
    dirty hands?' said Mr. Coon to himself, and he hurried to a
    quiet little pool to give them a good scrubbing. Then he washed
    his face and brushed his coat. 'Now I feel better, and I know
    my supper will taste better,' said he.</p>

    <p>"From that time he began to be particular, very particular,
    about keeping himself clean, until finally there was no one on
    the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest quite so neat as Mr.
    Coon.</p>

    <p>"Now at this time Mr. Coon had a very plain tail. It was all
    of one color, a grayish white, not at all pretty. Mr. Coon used
    to think a great deal about that tail and wish and wish that it
    was handsome. Sometimes he used to envy Mr. Fox his beautiful
    red tail with its black and white tip. One day, as he sat on an
    old log with his chin in his hands, thinking about his tail,
    who should come along but Old Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>"'Good morning, Mr. Coon,' said she in her pleasantest
    voice.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Coon got up and made a very low bow. 'Good morning,
    Mother Nature,' he replied in his politest manner, which was
    very polite indeed.</p>

    <p>"'What were you thinking about so hard?' asked Old Mother
    Nature.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Coon looked a little bit ashamed. Then he sighed. 'I
    was wishing that my tail was handsomer,' said he. 'But it is a
    very good tail as it is,' he added hastily.</p>

    <p>"Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled. She sat down beside Mr.
    Coon and asked him all about his affairs, just as if she didn't
    know all about them already. She told him how pleased she was
    to find him so neat and clean, and Mr. Coon just tingled all
    over with pleasure. At last she got up to go, and her eyes
    twinkled more than ever, as she said:</p>

    <p>"'By the way, Mr. Coon, I am so pleased with your neatness
    that I am leaving you a reward. I hope you will like it.'</p>

    <p>"Mr. Coon didn't see any reward, but he thanked her just the
    same, and Old Mother Nature went on her way. Mr. Coon watched
    her out of sight. Then he sat down on the old log again and
    scratched his head thoughtfully as he looked this way and
    that.</p>

    <p>"'I wonder what she meant by reward. I don't see any
    anywhere,' he said to himself.</p>

    <p>"By and by he just happened to glance at his tail. 'Oh!'
    cried Mr. Coon, and then for a long time he couldn't say
    another word, but just looked and looked with shining eyes and
    such a queer feeling of happiness in his heart. You see, Old
    Mother Nature had left a beautiful, broad, black ring around
    his tail. Mr. Coon couldn't do anything the rest of that day
    but look at and admire that ring, until his neck ached from
    twisting it around so long.</p>

    <p>"After that he was neater than ever, you may be sure, and
    the next time Old Mother Nature came around, she left another
    handsome black ring on his tail, because he hadn't grown
    careless, but had kept up his good habits.</p>

    <p>"Now about this time, hard times came to all the little
    people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows. Every one
    began to grumble. Mr. Bear grumbled. Mr. Fox grumbled. Mr.
    Rabbit grumbled. Mr. Jay grumbled. Mr. Squirrel grumbled. Even
    Mr. Chuck grumbled. And one and all they began to blame Old
    Mother Nature. Then they began to quarrel among themselves and
    to steal from each other. Some even left their homes and went
    out into the Great World to try to find a better place to live,
    only to find that the Great World was a harder place to live in
    than the Green Forest and the Green Meadows.</p>

    <p>"But Mr. Coon didn't grumble, and he didn't go away. No,
    Sir, Mr. Coon just stuck to his home and did the best he could
    to find enough to eat. He kept himself as neat as ever and was
    always cheerful. Whenever he met one of his grumbling
    neighbors, he would say:</p>

    <p>"'Better times coming! Better times coming! Old Mother
    Nature is doing the best she can. Better times coming!'</p>

    <p>"The others would laugh at him for his faith in Old Mother
    Nature, and say ugly things about her, and urge Mr. Coon to go
    with them out into the Great World. But he kept right on
    minding his own business and keeping neat and cheerful, until
    at last Old Mother Nature, all worried and troubled, came to
    see what she could do to straighten matters out. It didn't take
    her long to find out how all the little meadow and forest
    people, except Mr. Coon, had grumbled and been discontented and
    said ugly things about her, for you can't fool Old Mother
    Nature, and it's of no use to try. Some she punished one way,
    and some she punished another way, for of course she hadn't
    been to blame for the hard times, but had been working night
    and day to put an end to them.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Coon was the last to be called before her, and instead
    of being frowning and cross, as she had been to the others, she
    was all smiles. She said a lot of nice things to him, and when
    at last she sent him away, what do you think she had given
    him?"</p>

    <p>"More rings," cried Peter Rabbit.</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied Grandfather Frog, "Mr. Coon's tail was ringed
    way to the tip. There was one for cheerfulness, and one for
    faith, and one for persistence in making the best of a bad
    matter and staying at home. And ever since that long-ago day
    when the world was young, the Coons have been very proud of
    their beautiful tails and have kept up the good habits of old
    Mr. Coon. Now you know, Peter Rabbit, why Bobby Coon wears
    rings on his tail," concluded Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter gave a long sigh. "I think it's perfectly beautiful,"
    he said. "I wish I had rings on my tail."</p>

    <p>And then he wondered why everybody laughed.</p>

    <h3>WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY</h3>

    <p>Ol' Mistah Buzzard had just told the story of why he has a
    bald head and is proud of it. You know he hasn't a feather on
    it, and it is very, very red. It was a very interesting story,
    and it had been listened to with the closest attention by a lot
    of the little meadow and forest people. Unc' Billy Possum, who
    is Ol' Mistah Buzzard's particular friend, both having come
    from "way down souf," happened along just in time to hear the
    end of it.</p>

    <p>"May Ah ask yo' a question, Brer Buzzard?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Cert'nly, Brer Possum. Cert'nly," replied Ol' Mistah
    Buzzard.</p>

    <p>"Is Buzzard really your fam'ly name?" asked Unc' Billy.</p>

    <p>"No, Brer Possum, it isn't," replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard.
    Everybody looked surprised. You see, no one ever had heard him
    called anything but Buzzard. But no one said anything, and
    after a minute or two Ol' Mistah Buzzard explained.</p>

    <p>"Mah fam'ly name is Vulture," said he. "Yes, Sah, mah fam'ly
    name is Vulture, but we-uns done been called Buzzards so long,
    that Ah don' know as Ah would know Ah was being spoken to, if
    Ah was called Mistah Vulture."</p>

    <p>"An' do Ah understand that all of your fam'ly have red
    haids?" inquired Unc' Billy.</p>

    <p>Ol' Mistah Buzzard looked down at Unc' Billy, and he saw a
    twinkle in Unc' Billy's shrewd little eyes. Ol' Mistah Buzzard
    grinned.</p>

    <p>"Ah knows jes' what yo' done got in your mind, Brer Possum,"
    said he. "It's that trifling, no 'count cousin of mine. He's a
    Buzzard, or a Vulture, if yo' like that better, jes' like Ah
    am, but he belongs to another branch of the fam'ly. He has a
    bald haid, jes' like Ah have, but his haid is black instead of
    red. That's because his grandpap was trifling an' po' trash,
    jes' like he is."</p>

    <p>Peter Rabbit pricked up his ears. This sounded like another
    story. He was curious about that black-headed cousin of Ol'
    Mistah Buzzard, very curious indeed. He wondered if Ol' Mistah
    Buzzard would have to be teased for a story, like Grandfather
    Frog. Anyway, he would find out. There would be no harm in
    trying.</p>

    <p>"If you please, how does your cousin happen to have a black
    head?" asked Peter as politely as he knew how.</p>

    <p>"Because his grandpap asked too many questions," replied Ol'
    Mistah Buzzard, slyly winking at the others.</p>

    <p>Everybody laughed, for everybody knows that no one asks more
    questions than Peter Rabbit. Peter laughed with the rest,
    although he looked a wee bit foolish. But he didn't mean to
    give up just because he was laughed at. Oh, my, no!</p>

    <p>"Please, Mr. Buzzard, please tell us the story," he
    begged.</p>

    <p>Now Ol' Mistah Buzzard is naturally good-natured and
    accommodating, and when Peter begged so hard, he just couldn't
    find it in his heart to refuse. Besides, he rather enjoys
    telling stories. So he shook his feathers out, half spread his
    wings to let the air blow under them, looked down at all the
    little meadow and forest people gathered about the foot of the
    tall, dead tree where he delights to roost, grinned at them in
    the funniest way, and then began this story:</p>

    <p>"Way back in the days when Grandpap Buzzard had his lil
    falling out with ol' King Eagle and done fly so high he sco'tch
    the feathers offen his haid, he had a cousin, did Grandpap
    Buzzard, and this cousin was jes' naturally lazy and no 'count.
    Like most no 'count people, he used to make a regular nuisance
    of hisself, poking his nose into ev'ybody's business and never
    'tending to his own. Wasn't anything going on that this
    trifling member of the Buzzard fam'ly didn't find out about and
    meddle in. He could ask mo' questions than Peter Rabbit can,
    an' anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot."</p>

    <p>Everybody looked at Peter and laughed. Peter made a funny
    face and laughed too.</p>

    <p>"Seemed like he jes' went 'round from mo'ning to night
    asking questions," continued Ol' Mistah Buzzard, "Got so that
    eve'ybody dreaded to see that no 'count Buzzard coming, because
    he bound to pester with questions about things what don't
    concern him no ways.</p>

    <p>"Now yo' know that way down in Ol' Virginny where Ah done
    come from, mah fam'ly done got the habit of sitting on the tops
    of chimneys in the wintertime to warm their toes."</p>

    <p>"Why, I thought it was warm down south!" interrupted Peter
    Rabbit.</p>

    <p>"So it is, Brer Rabbit! So it is!" Ol' Mistah Buzzard
    hastened to say. "But yo' see, ol' Jack Frost try to come down
    there sometimes, an' he cool the air off a right smart lot
    before he turn tail an' run back where he belong. So we-uns sit
    on the chimney-tops whenever ol' Jack Frost gets to straying
    down where he have no business. Yo' see, if we-uns keep our
    toes warm, we-uns are warm all over.</p>

    <p>"One day this no 'count, trifling cousin of Grandpap Buzzard
    get cold in his feet. He look 'round right smart fo' a chimney
    fo' to warm his toes, an' pretty soon he see one where he never
    been before. It was on a lil ol' house, a lil ol' tumble-down
    house. Mistah Buzzard fly right over an' sit on that
    chimney-top fo' to warm his toes. Of course he right smart
    curious about that lil ol' tumble-down house and who live
    there. He hear somebody inside talking to theirself, but he
    can't hear what they say, jes' a mumbling sound that come up
    the chimney to him.</p>

    <p>"He listen an' listen. Then he shift 'round to the other
    side of the chimney an' listen. No matter where he sit, he
    can't hear what being said down inside that lil ol' tumble-down
    house. Then what do yo' think Mistah Buzzard do? Why, he jes'
    stretch his fool haid as far down that chimney as he can an'
    listen an' listen. Yes, Sah, that is jes' what that no 'count
    Buzzard do. But all he hear is jes' a mumbling and a mumbling,
    an' that make him more curious than ever. It seem to him that
    he must go clean outen his haid 'less he hear what going on
    down inside that lil ol' house.</p>

    <p>"Now when he stretch his haid an' neck down the chimney that
    way, he get 'em all black with soot. But he don't mind that.
    No, Sah, he don' mind that a bit. Fact is, he don' notice it.
    He so curious he don' notice anything, an' pretty soon he plumb
    fo'get where he is an' that he is listening where he have no
    business. He plumb fo'get all about this, an' he holler down
    that chimney. Yes, Sah, he holler right down that chimney!</p>

    <p>"'Will yo'-alls please speak a lil louder,' he holler down
    the chimney, jes' like that.</p>

    <p>"Now the lil ol' woman what lived by herself in that lil ol'
    tumble-down house hadn't seen that no 'count Buzzard light on
    the chimney fo' to warm his toes, an' when she hear that voice
    coming right outen the fireplace, she was some flustrated and
    scared, was that lil ol' woman. Yes, Sah, she sho'ly was plumb
    scared. She so scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup
    right in the fire. Of course that make a terrible mess an' a
    powerful lot of smoke an' hot ashes fly up the chimney. They
    like to choke that no 'count Buzzard to death. They burn the
    feathers offen his haid an' neck, an' the soot make him black,
    all but his feet an' laigs an' the inside of his wings, which
    he keep closed.</p>

    <p>"Mistah Buzzard he give a mighty squawk an' fly away. When
    he get home, he try an' try to brush that soot off, but it done
    get into the skin an' it stay there. An' from that day his haid
    an' neck stay black, an' he never speak lessen he spoken to,
    an' then he only grunt. His chillen jes' like him, an' his
    chillen's chillen the same way. An' that is the reason that mah
    cousin who lives down souf done have a black haid," concluded
    Ol' Mistah Buzzard.</p>

    <p>A little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of
    listeners. As usual, Peter Rabbit was the first to speak.</p>

    <p>"That was a splendid story, Mr. Buzzard," said he, "and I'm
    ever and ever so much obliged to you. It was just as good as
    one of Grandfather Frog's."</p>

    <p>0l' Mistah Buzzard grinned and slowly winked one eye at Unc'
    Billy Possum as he replied: "Thank yo', Brer Rabbit. That's
    quite the nicest thing yo' could say."</p>

    <p>"But it's true!" shouted all together, and then everybody
    gave three cheers for Ol' Mistah Buzzard before starting off to
    attend to their own private affairs.</p>

    <h2><a name="XIII"
       id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

    <h3>WHY BUSTER BEAR APPEARS TO HAVE NO TAIL</h3>

    <p>Peter Rabbit had something new to bother his bump of
    curiosity. And it did bother it a lot. He had just seen Buster
    Bear for the first time, and what do you think had impressed
    him most? Well, it wasn't Buster's great size, or wonderful
    strength, or big claws, or deep, grumbly-rumbly voice. No, Sir,
    it wasn't one of these. It was the fact that Buster Bear seemed
    to have no tail! Peter couldn't get over that. He almost pitied
    Buster Bear. You see, Peter has a great admiration for fine
    tails. He has always been rather ashamed of the funny little
    one he has himself. Still, it is a real tail, and he has often
    comforted himself with that thought.</p>

    <p>So the first thing Peter did when he saw Buster Bear was to
    look to see what kind of a tail he had. Just imagine how
    surprised he was when he couldn't make sure that Buster had any
    tail at all. There was something that might, just might, be
    meant for a tail, and Peter wasn't even sure of that. If it
    was, it was so ridiculously small that Peter felt that he had
    no reason to be ashamed of his own tail.</p>

    <p>He was still thinking about this when he started for home.
    Half way there, he paused, saw that the way to the Smiling Pool
    was clear, and suddenly made up his mind to ask Grandfather
    Frog about Buster Bear's tail. Off he started,
    lipperty-lipperty-lip.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Grandfather Frog," he panted, as soon as he reached the
    edge of the Smiling Pool, "has Buster Bear got a tail?"</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog regarded Peter in silence for a minute or
    two.</p>

    <p>Then very slowly he asked: "What are your eyes for, Peter
    Rabbit? Couldn't you see whether or not he has a tail?"</p>

    <p>"No, Grandfather Frog. I really couldn't tell whether he has
    a tail or not," replied Peter quite truthfully. "At first I
    thought he hadn't, and then I thought he might have. If he has,
    it doesn't seem to me that it is enough to call a really truly
    tail."</p>

    <p>"Well, it is a really truly tail, even if you don't think
    so," retorted Grandfather Frog, "and he has it for a
    reminder."</p>

    <p>"A reminder!" exclaimed Peter, looking very much puzzled. "A
    reminder of what?"</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or three times. "Sit
    down, Peter, and learn a lesson from the tale of the tail of
    Old King Bear," said he very seriously.</p>

    <p>"You remember that once upon a time, long ago, when the
    world was young, Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest, and
    everybody brought tribute to him."</p>

    <p>Peter nodded and Grandfather Frog went on.</p>

    <p>"Now Old King Bear was the great-great-ever-so-great
    grandfather of Buster Bear, and he looked very much as Buster
    does, except that he didn't have any tail at all, not the least
    sign of a tail. At first, before he was made king of the Green
    Forest, he didn't mind this at all. In fact, he was rather
    pleased that he didn't have a tail. You see, he couldn't think
    of any earthly use he would have for a tail, and so he was glad
    that he hadn't got one to bother with.</p>

    <p>"This was just Old Mother Nature's view of the matter. She
    had done her very best to give everybody everything that they
    really needed, and not to give them things which they didn't
    need. She couldn't see that Mr. Bear had the least need of a
    tail, and so she hadn't given him one. Mr. Bear was perfectly
    happy without one, and was so busy getting enough to eat that
    he didn't have time for silly thoughts or vain wishes.</p>

    <p>"Then he was made king over all the people of the Green
    Forest, and his word was law. It was a very great honor, and
    for a while he felt it so and did his best to rule wisely. He
    went about just as before, hunting for his living, and had no
    more time than before for foolish thoughts or vain wishes. But
    after a little, the little people over whom he ruled began to
    bring him tribute, so that he no longer had to hunt for enough
    to eat. Indeed, he had so much brought to him, that he couldn't
    begin to eat all of it, and he grew very dainty and fussy about
    what he did eat. Having nothing to do but eat and sleep, he
    grew very fat and lazy, as is the case with most people who
    have nothing to do. He grew so fat that when he walked, he
    puffed and wheezed. He grew so lazy that he wanted to be waited
    on all the time.</p>

    <p>"It happened about this time that he overheard Mr. Fox
    talking to Mr. Wolf when they both thought him asleep. 'A
    pretty kind of a king, he is!' sneered Mr. Fox. 'The idea of a
    king without a tail!'</p>

    <p>"'That's so,' assented Mr. Wolf. 'Why, even that little
    upstart, Mr. Rabbit, has got a make-believe tail.'"</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog's eyes twinkled as he said this, and Peter
    looked very much embarrassed. But he didn't say anything, so
    Grandfather Frog went on.</p>

    <p>"Old King Bear pretended to wake up just then, and right
    away Mr. Fox and Mr. Wolf were as polite and smiling as you
    please and began to flatter him. They told him how proud they
    were of their king, and how handsome he was, and a lot of other
    nice things, all of which he had heard often before and had
    believed. He pretended to believe them now, but after they were
    through paying their respects and had gone away, he kept
    turning over and over in his mind what he had overheard them
    say when they thought he was asleep.</p>

    <p>"After that he couldn't think of anything but the fact that
    he hadn't any tail. He took particular notice of all who came
    to pay him tribute, and he saw that every one of them had a
    tail. Some had long tails; some had short tails; some had
    handsome tails and some had homely tails; but everybody had a
    tail of some kind. The more he tried not to think of these
    tails, the more he did think of them. The more he thought of
    them, the more discontented he grew because he had none. He
    didn't stop to think that probably all of them had use for
    their tails. No, Sir, he didn't think of that. Everybody else
    had a tail, and he hadn't. He felt that it was a disgrace that
    he, the king, should have no tail. He brooded over it so much
    that he lost his appetite and grew cross and peevish.</p>

    <p>"Then along came Old Mother Nature to see how things were
    going in the Green Forest. Of course she saw right away that
    something was wrong with Old King Bear. When she asked him what
    the matter was, he was ashamed to tell her at first. But after
    a little he told her that he wanted a tail; that he could never
    again be happy unless he had a tail. She told him that he
    hadn't the least use in the world for a tail, and that he
    wouldn't be any happier if he had one. Nothing that she could
    say made any difference&mdash;he wanted a tail. Finally she
    gave him one.</p>

    <p>"For a few days Old King Bear was perfectly happy. He spent
    all his spare time admiring his new tail. He called the
    attention of all his subjects to it, and they all told him that
    it was a very wonderful tail and was very becoming to him. But
    it wasn't long before he found that his new tail was very much
    in the way. It bothered him when he walked. It was in the way
    when he sat down. It was a nuisance when he climbed a tree. He
    didn't have a single use for it, and yet he had to carry it
    with him wherever he went. Worse still, he overheard little Mr.
    Squirrel and Mr. Possum making fun of it. And then he
    discovered that the very ones who admired his tail so to his
    face were laughing at him and poking fun at him behind his
    back.</p>

    <p>"And then Old King Bear wished that he <i>hadn't</i> a tail
    more than ever he wished that he <i>did</i> have a tail. Again
    he lost his appetite and grew cross and peevish, so that no one
    dared come near him. So matters went from bad to worse, until
    once more Old Mother Nature visited the Green Forest to see how
    things were. Very humbly Old King Bear went down on his knees
    and begged her to take away his tail. At first Old Mother
    Nature refused, but he begged so hard and promised so
    faithfully never again to be discontented, that finally she
    relented and took away his tail, all but just a wee little bit.
    That she left as a reminder lest he should forget the lesson he
    had learned and should again grow envious.</p>

    <h3>WHY FLITTER THE BAT FLIES AT NIGHT</h3>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a href="images/006-lg.png"
             name="fig06"
             id="fig06"><img src="images/006-sm.png"
             alt="&quot;It must be fine to fly,&quot; thought Peter. &quot;I wish I could fly.&quot;" />
        </a>

        <h4>"It must be fine to fly," thought Peter. "I wish I
        could fly."</h4>
    </div>

    <p class="dropcap">Flitter the Bat made Peter Rabbit's head
    dizzy. Peter couldn't help watching him. He just had to. It
    seemed so wonderful that Flitter could really fly, that
    whenever he saw him, Peter had to stop and watch. And then, as
    he saw Flitter twist and turn, fly high, fly low, and go round
    and round, Peter's head would begin to swim and grow dizzy, and
    he wondered and wondered how it was that Flitter himself didn't
    grow dizzy.</p>

    <p>"It must be fine to fly," thought Peter. "I wish I could
    fly. If I could, I wouldn't spend all my time flying around the
    way Flitter does. I'd go on long journeys and see the Great
    World. I'd fly way, way up in the blue, blue sky, the way Ol'
    Mistah Buzzard does, where I could look down and see all that
    is going on in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. And
    I'd fly in the daytime, because there is more going on then. I
    wonder, now, why it is that Flitter never comes out until after
    jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple
    Hills. I never see him in the daytime, and I don't even know
    where he keeps himself. I never thought of it before, but I
    wonder why it is that he flies only at night. I believe I'll
    ask Grandfather Frog the very next time I see him."</p>

    <p>Now you know that once Peter Rabbit's curiosity is aroused,
    it just has to be satisfied. No sooner did he begin to wonder
    about Flitter the Bat than he could think of nothing else. So
    he watched until the way was clear, and then he started for the
    Smiling Pool as fast as he could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He
    hoped he would find Grandfather Frog sitting as usual on his
    big green lily-pad, and that he would be good-natured. If he
    wasn't feeling good-natured, it would be of no use to ask him
    for a story.</p>

    <p>When Peter reached the Smiling Pool he was disappointed,
    terribly disappointed. The big green lily-pad was there, but
    there was no one sitting on it. Somehow the Smiling Pool didn't
    seem quite like itself without Grandfather Frog sitting there
    watching for foolish green flies. Peter's face showed just how
    disappointed he felt. He was just going to turn away when a
    great, deep voice said:</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! Where are your manners, Peter Rabbit, that you
    forget to speak to your elders?"</p>

    <p>Peter stared eagerly into the Smiling Pool, and presently he
    saw two great, goggly eyes and the top of a green head, way out
    almost in the middle of the Smiling Pool. It was Grandfather
    Frog himself, having his morning swim.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Grandfather Frog, I didn't see you at all!" cried
    Peter, "If I had, of course I would have spoken. The fact is,
    I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You want a story," finished Grandfather Frog for him. "You
    can't fool me, Peter Rabbit. You came over here just to ask me
    for a story. I know you, Peter! I know you! Well, what is it
    this time?"</p>

    <p>"If you please," replied Peter politely and happily, for he
    saw that Grandfather Frog was feeling good-natured, "why is it
    that Flitter the Bat flies only at night?"</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog climbed out on his big green lily-pad and
    made himself comfortable. Peter sat still and tried not to show
    how impatient he felt. Grandfather Frog took his time. It
    tickled him to see how hard impatient Peter was trying to be
    patient, and his big, goggly eyes twinkled.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said he at last, with a suddenness that made
    Peter jump. "That's very good, Peter, very good indeed! Now
    I'll tell you the story."</p>

    <p>Of course he meant that Peter's effort to keep still was
    very good, but Peter didn't know this, and he couldn't imagine
    what Grandfather Frog meant. However, what he cared most about
    was the story, so he settled himself to listen, his long ears
    standing straight up, and his eyes stretched wide open as he
    watched Grandfather Frog. The latter cleared his throat two or
    three times, each time as if he intended to begin right then.
    It was one of Grandfather Frog's little jokes. He did it just
    to tease Peter. At last he really did begin, and the very first
    thing he did was to ask Peter a question.</p>

    <p>"What is the reason that you stay in the dear Old
    Briar-patch when Reddy Fox is around?"</p>

    <p>"So that he won't catch me, of course," replied Peter.</p>

    <p>"Very good," said Grandfather Frog. "Now, why do you go over
    to the sweet-clover patch every day?"</p>

    <p>"Why, because there is plenty to eat there," replied Peter,
    looking very, very much puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Well, now you've answered your own question," grunted
    Grandfather Frog. "Flitter flies at night because he is safest
    then, and because he can find plenty to eat."</p>

    <p>"Oh," said Peter, and his voice sounded dreadfully
    disappointed. He had found out what he had wanted to know, but
    he hadn't had a story. He fidgeted about and looked very hard
    at Grandfather Frog, but the latter seemed to think that he had
    told Peter what he wanted to know, and that was all there was
    to it. Finally Peter sighed, and it was such a heavy sigh! Then
    very slowly he turned his back on the Smiling Pool and started
    to hop away.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest,
    story-telling voice. "A long time ago when the world was young,
    the great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Flitter the Bat
    first learned to fly."</p>

    <p>"I know!" cried Peter eagerly. "You told me about that, and
    it was a splendid story."</p>

    <p>"But when he learned to fly, he found that Old Mother Nature
    never gives all her blessings to any single one of her little
    people," continued Grandfather Frog, without paying the least
    attention to Peter's interruption. "Old Mr. Bat had wings;
    something no other animal had, but he found that he could no
    longer run and jump. He could just flop about on the ground,
    and was almost helpless. Of course that meant that he could
    very easily be caught, and so the ground was no longer a safe
    place for him. But he soon found that he was not safe in the
    air in daytime. Old Mr. Hawk could fly even faster than he, and
    Mr. Hawk was always watching for him. At first, Mr. Bat didn't
    know what to do. He didn't like to go to Old Mother Nature and
    complain that his new wings were not all that he had thought
    they would be. That would look as if he were ungrateful for her
    kindness in giving him the wings.</p>

    <p>"'I've got to think of some way out of my troubles myself,'
    thought old Mr. Bat. 'When I'm sure that I can't, it will be
    time enough to go to Old Mother Nature.'</p>

    <p>"Now of course it is very hard to think when you are
    twisting and dodging and turning in the air."</p>

    <p>"Of course!" said Peter Rabbit, just as if he knew all about
    it.</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Bat went looking for a place where he could be quiet
    all by himself and think without danger of being gobbled up for
    some one's dinner," continued Grandfather Frog. "He flew and he
    flew and had almost given up hope of finding any such place
    when he saw a cave. It looked very black inside, but it was big
    enough for Mr. Bat to fly into, and in he went. He knew that
    Mr. Hawk would never come in there, and when he found a little
    shelf up near the roof, he knew that he was safe from any
    four-footed enemies who might follow him there. It was just the
    place to rest and think. So he rested, and while he rested, he
    thought and thought.</p>

    <p>"By and by he noticed that it was growing dark outside. 'My
    goodness! If I am going to get anything to eat to-day, I shall
    have to hurry,' thought he. When he got outside, he found that
    Mr. Sun had gone to bed. So had all the birds, except Mr. Owl
    and Mr. Nighthawk. Now Mr. Nighthawk doesn't belong to the Hawk
    family at all, so there was nothing to fear from him. Then Mr.
    Bat had a very pleasant surprise. He found the air full of
    insects, ever so many more than in the daytime. By being very
    smart and quick he caught a few before it was too dark for him
    to see. They didn't fill his stomach, but they kept him from
    starving. As he flew back to the cave, a great idea came to
    him, the idea for which he had been thinking so hard. He would
    sleep days in the cave, where he was perfectly safe, and come
    out to hunt bugs and insects just as soon as Mr. Hawk had gone
    to bed! Then he would be safe and would not have to complain to
    Old Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>"At first old Mr. Bat, who wasn't old then, you know, had
    hard work to catch enough insects before it grew too dark, but
    he found that every night he could see a little longer and a
    little better than the night before, until by and by he could
    see as well in the dusk as he used to see in the daytime. Then
    he realized that Old Mother Nature had once more been very good
    to him, and that she had helped him just as she always helps
    those who help themselves. She had given him night-seeing eyes,
    and he no more had to go hungry.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Bat was very grateful, and from that day to this, Bats
    have been content to live in caves and fly in the evening. You
    ask Flitter if it isn't so."</p>

    <p>Peter grinned. "He never stays in one place long enough for
    me to ask him anything," said he. "I'm ever so much obliged for
    the story, Grandfather Frog. It pays to make the best of what
    we have, doesn't it?"</p>

    <p>"It certainly does. Chug-a-rum! It certainly does!" replied
    Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <h2><a name="XV"
       id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

    <h3>WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM</h3>

    <p>Spotty the Turtle sat on an old log on the bank of the
    Smiling Pool, taking a sun-bath. He had sat that way for the
    longest time without once moving. Peter Rabbit had seen him
    when he went by on his way to the Laughing Brook and the Green
    Forest to look for some one to pass the time of day with.
    Spotty was still there when Peter returned a long time after,
    and he didn't look as if he had moved. A sudden thought struck
    Peter. He couldn't remember that he ever had seen Spotty's
    house. He had seen the houses of most of his other friends, but
    think as hard as ever he could, he didn't remember having seen
    Spotty's.</p>

    <p>"Hi, Spotty!" he shouted. "Where do you live?"</p>

    <p>Spotty slowly turned his head and looked up at Peter. There
    was a twinkle in his eyes, though Peter didn't see it.</p>

    <p>"Right here in the Smiling Pool. Where else should I live?"
    he replied.</p>

    <p>"I mean, where is your house?" returned Peter. "Of course I
    know you live in the Smiling Pool, but where is your house? Is
    it in the bank or down under water?"</p>

    <p>"It is just wherever I happen to be. Just now it is right
    here," said Spotty. "I always take it with me wherever I go; I
    find it much the handiest way."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a href="images/007-lg.png"
             name="fig07"
             id="fig07"><img src="images/007-sm.png"
             alt="&quot;Hi, Spotty!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Where do you live?&quot;" />
        </a>

        <h4>"Hi, Spotty!" he shouted. "Where do you live?"</h4>
    </div>

    <p>With that Spotty disappeared. That is to say, his head and
    legs and tail disappeared. Peter stared very hard. Then he
    began to laugh, for it came to him that what Spotty had said
    was true. His house was with him, and now he had simply retired
    inside. He didn't need any other house than just that hard,
    spotted shell, inside of which he was now so cosily tucked
    away.</p>

    <p>"That's a great idea! Ho, ho, ho! That's a great idea!"
    shouted Peter.</p>

    <p>"Of course it is," replied Spotty, putting nothing but his
    head out, "You will always find me at home whenever you call,
    Peter, and that is more than you can say of most other
    people."</p>

    <p>All the way to his own home in the dear Old Briar-patch,
    Peter thought about Spotty and how queer it was that he should
    carry his house around with him.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how it happens that he does it," thought he. "No
    wonder he is so slow. Of course, it is very handy to have his
    house always with him. As he says, he is always at home. Still,
    when he is in a hurry to get away from an enemy, it must be
    very awkward to have to carry his house on his back.
    I&mdash;I&mdash;why, how stupid of me! He doesn't have to run
    away at all! All he has got to do is to go inside his house and
    stay there until the danger is past! I never thought of that
    before. Why, that is the handiest thing I ever heard of."</p>

    <p>Now Peter knew that there must be a good story about Spotty
    and his house, and you know Peter dearly loves a good story. So
    at the very first opportunity the next day, he hurried over to
    the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather Frog about it. As usual,
    Grandfather Frog was sitting on his big green lily-pad. No
    sooner did Peter pop his head above the edge of the bank of the
    Smiling Pool than Grandfather Frog exclaimed:</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! You've kept me waiting a long time, Peter
    Rabbit. I don't like to be kept waiting. If you wanted to know
    about Spotty the Turtle, why didn't you come earlier?" All the
    time there was a twinkle in the big, goggly eyes of Grandfather
    Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter was so surprised that he couldn't find his tongue. He
    hadn't said a word to any one about Spotty, so how could
    Grandfather Frog know what he had come for? For a long time he
    had had a great deal of respect for Grandfather Frog, who, as
    you know, is very old and very wise, but now Peter felt almost
    afraid of him. You see, it seemed to Peter as if Grandfather
    Frog had read his very thoughts.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I didn't know you were waiting. Truly I didn't,"
    stammered Peter. "If I had, I would have been here long ago. If
    you please, how did you know that I was coming and what I was
    coming for?"</p>

    <p>"Never mind how I knew. I know a great deal that I don't
    tell, which is more than some folks can say," replied
    Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>Peter wondered if he meant him, for you know Peter is a
    great gossip. But he didn't say anything, because he didn't
    know just what to say, and in a minute Grandfather Frog began
    the story Peter so much wanted.</p>

    <p>"Of course you know, without me telling you, that there is a
    reason for Spotty's carrying his house around with him, because
    there is a reason for everything in this world. And of course
    you know that that reason is because of something that happened
    a long time ago, way back in the days when the world was young.
    Almost everything to-day is the result of things that happened
    in those long-ago days. The great-great-ever-so-great
    grandfather of Spotty the Turtle lived then, and unlike Spotty,
    whom you know, he had no house. He was very quiet and bashful,
    was Mr. Turtle, and he never meddled with any one's business,
    because he believed that the best way of keeping out of trouble
    was to attend strictly to his own affairs.</p>

    <p>"He was a good deal like Spotty, just as fond of the water
    and just as slow moving, but he didn't have the house which
    Spotty has now. If he had had, he would have been saved a great
    deal of trouble and worry. For a long time everybody lived at
    peace with everybody else. Then came the trying time, of which
    you already know, when those who lived on the Green Meadows and
    in the Green Forest had the very hardest kind of work to find
    enough to eat, and were hungry most of the time. Now Mr.
    Turtle, living in the Smiling Pool, had plenty to eat. He had
    nothing to worry about on that score. Everybody who lives in
    the Smiling Pool knows that it is the best place in the world,
    anyway."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog winked at Jerry Muskrat, who was listening,
    and Jerry nodded his head.</p>

    <p>"But presently Mr. Turtle discovered that the big people
    were eating the little people whenever they could catch them,
    and that he wasn't safe a minute when on shore, and not always
    safe in the water," continued Grandfather Frog. "He had two or
    three very narrow escapes, and these set him to thinking. He
    was too slow and awkward to run or to fight. The only thing he
    could do was to keep out of sight as much as possible. So he
    learned to swim with only his head out of water, and sometimes
    with only the end of his nose out of water. When he went on
    land, he would cover himself with mud, and then when he heard
    anybody coming, he would lie perfectly still, with his legs and
    his tail and his head drawn in just as close as possible, so
    that he looked for all the world like just a little lump of
    brown earth.</p>

    <p>"One day he had crawled under a piece of bark to rest and at
    the same time keep out of sight of any who might happen along.
    When he got ready to go on his way, he found that the piece of
    bark had caught on his back, and that he was carrying it with
    him. At first he was annoyed and started to shake it off.
    Before he succeeded, he heard someone coming, so he promptly
    drew in his head and legs and tail. It was Mr. Fisher, and he
    was very hungry and fierce. He looked at the piece of bark
    under which Mr. Turtle was hiding, but all he saw was the bark,
    because, you know, Mr. Turtle had drawn himself wholly
    under.</p>

    <p>"'I believe,' said Mr. Fisher, talking out loud to himself,
    'that I'll have a look around the Smiling Pool and see if I can
    catch that slow-moving Turtle who lives there. I believe he'll
    make me a good dinner.'</p>

    <p>"Of course Mr. Turtle heard just what he said, and he
    blessed the piece of bark which had hidden him from Mr.
    Fisher's sight. For a long time he lay very still. When he did
    go on, he took the greatest care not to shake off that piece of
    bark, for he didn't know but that any minute he might want to
    hide under it again. At last he reached the Smiling Pool and
    slipped into the water, leaving the piece of bark on the bank.
    Thereafter, when he wanted to go on land, he would first make
    sure that no one was watching. Then he would crawl under the
    piece of bark and get it on his back. Wherever he went he
    carried the piece of bark so as to have it handy to hide
    under.</p>

    <p>"Now all this time Old Mother Nature had been watching Mr.
    Turtle, and it pleased her to see that he was smart enough to
    think of such a clever way of fooling his enemies. So she began
    to study how she could help Mr. Turtle. One day she came up
    behind him just as he sat down to rest. The piece of bark was
    uncomfortable and scratched his back, 'I wish,' said he,
    talking to himself, for he didn't know that any one else was
    near, 'I wish that I had a house of my own that I could carry
    on my back all the time and be perfectly safe when I was inside
    of it.'</p>

    <p>"'You shall have,' said Old Mother Nature, and reaching out,
    she touched his back and turned the skin into hard shell. Then
    she touched the skin of his stomach and turned that into hard
    shell. 'Now draw in your head and your legs and your tail,'
    said she.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Turtle did as he was told to do, and there he was in
    the very best and safest kind of a house, perfectly hidden from
    all his enemies!</p>

    <p>"'Oh, Mother Nature, how can I ever thank you?' he
    cried.</p>

    <p>"'By doing as you always have done, attending wholly to your
    own affairs,' replied Old Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>"So ever since that long-ago day when the world was young,
    all Turtles have carried their houses with them and never have
    meddled in things that don't concern them," concluded
    Grandfather Frog.</p>

    <p>"Oh, thank you, Grandfather Frog," exclaimed Peter, drawing
    a long breath. "That was a perfectly splendid thing for Old
    Mother Nature to do."</p>

    <p>Then he started for his own home in the dear Old
    Briar-patch, and all the way there he wondered and wondered how
    Grandfather Frog knew that he wanted that story, and to this
    day he hasn't found out. You see, he didn't notice that
    Grandfather Frog was listening when he asked Spotty about his
    house. Of course, Grandfather Frog knows Peter and his
    curiosity so well that he had guessed right away that Peter
    would come to him for the story, just as Peter did.</p>

    <h3>WHY PADDY THE BEAVER HAS A BROAD TAIL</h3>

    <p>Usually the thing that interests us most is something that
    we haven't got ourselves. It is that way with Peter Rabbit.
    Peter is not naturally envious. Oh, my, no! Peter is pretty
    well satisfied with what he has, which is quite as it should
    be. There is only one thing with which Peter is really
    dissatisfied, and it is only once in a while, when he hasn't
    much of anything else to think about, that he is dissatisfied
    with this. Can you guess what it is? Well, it is his tail. Yes,
    Sir, that is the one thing that ever really troubles Peter.</p>

    <p>You see, Peter's tail is, nothing but a funny little bunch
    of cotton, which doesn't look like a tail at all. The only time
    he ever sees it is when he is back to the Smiling Pool and
    looks over his shoulder at his reflection in the water, and
    then, of course, he really doesn't see his tail itself. So
    sometimes when Peter sees the fine tails of his neighbors, a
    little bit of envy creeps into his heart for just a little
    while. Why, even little Danny Meadow Mouse has a real tail,
    short as it is. And as for Happy Jack Squirrel and Reddy Fox
    and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk, everybody knows what beautiful
    tails they have. Once Peter thought about it so much that
    Grandfather Frog noticed how sober he was and asked Peter what
    the trouble was. When Peter told him that it seemed to him that
    Old Mother Nature had not been fair in giving him such a
    foolish little tail when she had given others such beautiful
    ones, Grandfather Frog just opened his big mouth and laughed
    until he had to hold his sides.</p>

    <p>"Why, Peter," said he, "you look so sober, that I thought
    you really had something to worry about. What would you do with
    a big tail, if you had one? It would always be in your way.
    Just think how many times Reddy Fox or old Granny Fox have
    almost caught you. They certainly would have before this, if
    you had had a long tail sticking out behind for them to get
    hold of. I had a long tail when I was young, and I was mighty
    glad to get rid of it."</p>

    <p>After he heard that, Peter felt better. But he didn't lose
    interest in tails, and he spent a great deal of time in
    wondering why some of his neighbors had big, bushy tails and
    some had long, slim tails and why he himself had almost no tail
    at all. So when Paddy the Beaver came to live in the Green
    Forest, and made a pond there by building a wonderful dam
    across the Laughing Brook, the first thing Peter looked to see
    was what kind of a tail Paddy has, and the first time he got a
    good look at it, his eyes popped almost out of his head. He
    just stared and stared. He hardly noticed the wonderful dam or
    the equally wonderful canals which Paddy had made. All he could
    think of was that great, broad, flat, thick tail, which is so
    unlike any tail he had ever seen or heard of.</p>

    <p>The very next morning he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to
    tell Grandfather Frog about it. Grandfather Frog's big, goggly
    eyes twinkled.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum!" said he. "Paddy the Beaver has one of the most
    useful tails I know of. Would you like to know how he comes by
    such a queer tail?"</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a href="images/008-lg.png"
             name="fig08"
             id="fig08"><img src="images/008-sm.png"
             alt="The first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a tail Paddy has." />
        </a>

        <h4>The first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a
        tail Paddy has.</h4>
    </div>

    <p>"Oh, if you please! If you please, Grandfather Frog! I
    didn't suppose there was such a queer tail in all the world,
    and I don't see what possible use it can be. Do tell me about
    it!" cried Peter.</p>

    <p>"Chug-a-rum! If you had used your eyes when you visited
    Paddy, you might have guessed for yourself how he came by it,"
    replied Grandfather Frog gruffly. "Some people never do learn
    to use their eyes."</p>

    <p>Peter looked a bit sheepish, but he said nothing and waited
    patiently. Presently Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or
    three times and began to talk.</p>

    <p>"Once upon a time, long, long ago, when the world was
    young&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"It seems to me that everything wonderful happened long ago
    when the world was young," interrupted Peter.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Frog looked at Peter severely, and Peter
    hastened to beg his pardon.</p>

    <p>After a long time Grandfather Frog began again.</p>

    <p>"Once on a time, long, long ago, lived Mr. Beaver, the
    great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Paddy up there in the
    Green Forest. Old Mr. Beaver was one of the hardest working of
    all of Old Mother Nature's big family and one of the smartest,
    just as Paddy is to-day. He always seemed happiest when he was
    busiest, and because he liked to be happy all the time, he
    tried to keep busy all the time.</p>

    <p>"He was very thrifty, was Mr. Beaver; not at all like some
    people I know. He believed in preparing to-day for what might
    happen to-morrow, and so when he had all the food he needed for
    the present, he stored away food for the time when it might not
    be so easy to get. And he believed in helping himself, did Mr.
    Beaver, and not in leaving everything to Old Mother Nature, as
    did most of his neighbors. That is how he first came to think
    of making a dam and a pond. Like his small cousin, Mr. Muskrat,
    he was very fond of the water, and felt most at home and safest
    there. But he found that sometimes the food which he liked
    best, which was the bark of certain kinds of trees, grew some
    distance from the water, and it was the hardest kind of hard
    work to roll and drag the logs down to the water, where he
    could eat the bark from them in safety.</p>

    <p>"He thought about this a great deal, but instead of going to
    Old Mother Nature and complaining, as most of his neighbors
    would have done in his place, he studied and studied to find
    some way to make the work easier. One day he noticed that a lot
    of sticks had caught in the stream where he made his home, and
    that because the water could not work its way between them as
    fast as where nothing hindered it, it made a little pool just
    above the sticks. That made him think harder than ever. He
    brought some of the logs and sticks from which he had gnawed
    the bark and fastened them with the others, and right away the
    pool grew bigger. The more sticks he added, the bigger the pool
    grew. Mr. Beaver had discovered what a dam is for and how to
    build it.</p>

    <p>"'Why,' thought he, 'if I make a pond at the place nearest
    to my food trees, I can carry the water to the trees instead of
    the trees to the water; and that will be easier and ever so
    much safer as well.'</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Beaver built a dam at just the right place, while
    all the other little people laughed at him and made fun of him
    for working so hard. Just as he had thought it would do, the
    dam made a pond, and the pond grew bigger and bigger, until it
    reached the very place where his food trees grew. Mr. Beaver
    built him a big, comfortable house out in the pond, and then he
    went to work as hard as ever he could to cut down trees and
    then cut them up into the right sized pieces to store away in
    his big food pile for the winter.</p>

    <p>"Now cutting down trees is hard work. Yes, Siree, cutting
    down trees is the hardest kind of hard work. Mr. Beaver had to
    sit up on his hind legs to do it, and his legs grew very, very
    tired. In those days he had a tail very much like the tail of
    Jerry Muskrat. It was very useful when he was swimming, but it
    was of no use at all at any other time. Sometimes he tried to
    brace himself with it&mdash;when he was sitting up to cut
    trees, and found it of no help. But he didn't complain; he just
    kept right on working, and only stopped to rest when his legs
    ached so that he had to.</p>

    <p>"He was working just as usual one day when Old Mother Nature
    came along to see how he was getting on. She saw the new dam
    and the new pond, and she asked Mr. Beaver who had made them.
    He told her that he had and explained why. Old Mother Nature
    was greatly pleased, but she didn't say so. She just passed the
    time of day with him and then sat down to watch him cut a tree.
    She saw him try to brace himself with his useless tail, and she
    saw him stop to rest his tired legs.</p>

    <p>"'That looks to me like pretty hard work,' said Old Mother
    Nature.</p>

    <p>"'So it is,' replied Mr. Beaver, stretching first one leg
    and then another. 'But things worth having are worth working
    for,' and with that he began cutting again.</p>

    <p>"'You ought to have something to sit on,' said Old Mother
    Nature, her eyes twinkling.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Beaver grinned. 'It would be very nice,' he confessed,
    'but I never waste time wishing for things I haven't got and
    can't get,' and went right on cutting.</p>

    <p>"The next morning when he awoke, he had the greatest
    surprise of his life. He had a new tail! It was broad and thick
    and flat. It wasn't like any tail he had ever seen or heard of.
    At first he didn't know how to manage it, but when he tried to
    swim, he found that it was even better than his old tail for
    swimming. He hurried over to begin his day's work, and there he
    made another discovery; his new tail was just the most splendid
    brace! It was almost like a stool to sit on, and he could work
    all day long without tiring his legs. Then was Mr. Beaver very
    happy, and to show how happy he was, he worked harder than
    ever. Later, he found that his new tail was just what he needed
    to pat down the mud with which he covered the roof of his
    house.</p>

    <p>"'Why,' he cried, 'I believe it is the most useful tail in
    all the world!'</p>

    <p>"And then he wished with all his might that Old Mother
    Nature would return so that he might thank her for it. And
    that," concluded Grandfather Frog, "is how Mr. Beaver came by
    his broad tail. You see, Old Mother Nature always helps those
    who help themselves. And ever since that long-ago day, all
    Beavers have had broad tails, and have been the greatest
    workers in the world."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
